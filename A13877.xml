            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Heras (Right Honorable) the reformation of thoſe which refuſe to ſerue God with vs in ſuch holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of religion as for this purpoſe are eſtabliſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt vs, hath bene carefully ſought by ſome puniſhment of their obſtinacie accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the good lawes prouided in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe: there are which complaine of this moderate ſeueritie, and both vnfitly &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duetifully terme it by the hatefull and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious name of perſecution. Of which ſort one hath written a whole treatiſe of this matter by way of an Epiſtle to his friende which he intitleth <hi>of the perſecution of Catholiques in England.</hi> In which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe the Authour is not afraide to offer moſt ſhamefull wrong to many faithfull officers of her Maieſties iuſtice, charging them with rigorous and cruell dealing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19102:3"/> who haue ſoberly and temperatly caried themſelues, in the execution of ſuch lawes vpon them, as their ill merit had wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily made them ſubiect vnto. By which bold ſlaunders, he giueth himſelfe occaſion, ſo to complaine and cry out of the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Catholiques in England: as if God had not ſet ouer vs and them, a gratious Ladie, of famous renoume for milde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and clemencie, who ſeeketh onely by a reaſonable correction to winne them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: firſt to almightie God, and then to her lawfull authoritie: but rather ſome cruell <hi>Nero</hi> or perſecuting <hi>Diocletian</hi> that deſired nothing but their deſtruction and their bloud. Which notwithſtanding it can not be vnknowne to any that liue in this ſtate to be a complaint moſt vniuſt, and vntrue: yet hath there ſtept vp an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as he would ſeeme to be) an abetter &amp; a voucher of that moſt ſlaunderous libel: yea a tranſlator a printer &amp; a publiſher of it vnto others: who herein hath worſe proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the credit of their vntruth then his authour had done before him. For he firſt had cunningly put his large ſpeach into the boſome of his fellow, as ready, as it ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be abuſed as he was willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him, hauing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> credulity of his friend &amp;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19102:3"/> the ſecrecy of his writing to conceale ſome part of his offence. But this tranſlator by printing and publiſhing of it, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our Engliſh tongue hath laide them both open to the iuſt reproofe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of all the lande: For what En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh man will not now condemne them both for falſe witneſſes againſt the church of God and their own countrie, when they ſhall reade or heare them in ſo many things to be ſo fowly defamed contrary to the knowledge of all the lande: but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally I maruell with what face hee coulde once offer to preſent it, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reuerend ſenate of your moſt honourable chamber. For howſoeuer he might flatter himſelfe to bee able to make ſome of the people affected to his cauſe, and dwelling farre from theſe parts, to beleue ſome peece of his ſlanders: yet coulde hee neuer be in anye hope, ſo to abuſe your H. who of your owne knoledge &amp; vnderſtanding are able to conuict him of ſo many vntruthes. Which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this Author fearing no rebuke nor ſhame for it (as ſpeking out of a vaut or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder a maſke by concealing of his name) hath imboldned him ſelfe to offer it euen vnto your Honors, with an other diſcourſe of his owne, which he entituleth an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19102:4"/> to the Councell. The ſubſtance of which his treatiſe is, that the cauſe of our pretended Catholiques is ſuch, as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth not the extremities which (vpon the credit by like of his Author) hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth to be vſed againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but rather is worthy to be well intreated, if for the tyme it may not haue all the honour hee eſteemeth to belong vnto it. Of which two epiſtles, the one being written in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine to a friend, concerning this pretended perſecution of Catholiques in Englande, hath beene alreadie ſufficiently anſwered by that reuerend Father Maiſter <hi>Doctor Humfrey</hi> in his late booke of <hi>Ieſuitiſme,</hi> or of the practiſes of the church of <hi>Roome.</hi> The other remaining yet vnanſwered, I was moued by ſome of my Friendes to the cauſe to take paines to make anſwere to it. Which at the firſt I confeſſe I was loath to take vpon me, notwithſtanding I ſawe the great aduantage I ſhould haue of mine aduerſary in the maintenance of a moſt holy and honourable quarrell. For conſidering ſo many excellent wittes, and ſo well able to deale in theſe cauſes, to ſit quyetly at their bookes, or peaceably to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difie the Church by preaching of the goſpel, whether it be that they feare the diuers e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19102:4"/> of writing, by reaſon of the exquiſite iudgements of the learned, and the bitter malice of the enimy: or that they eſteeme it vnprofitable for the Church to leaue or ſlack their other worthy labours, to ſtriue with a contentious aduerſary that will neuer be ſatiſfied: me thought their exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple was a good preſident for him to follow, that commeth ſo farre behinde ſo many of them in al ſufficiency for this purpoſe. But eſpecially I was willing to haue w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>drawen my ſelfe, for the reuerence I moſt worthily haue of the graue ſentences of your H. which I ſaw I could not eſcape, dealing in a matter wherewith your H. table is ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed alreadie. For knowing mine owne weakenes, I iuſtly feared to beginne my ſimple practiſe of this kinde of pleadinge in ſo high and honourable a Court, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch Iudges, whoſe wiſedomes can ſo eaſily diſcouer any want of thoſe which come before them. But when on the other ſide I ſet before me the price of the cauſe which we ſtriue for, the qualitie of my vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation &amp; calling, the moſt vnworthy ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ders wherew<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the enimy chargeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacred truth of God, and the lawful authoritie of this land: I could not ſee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> former
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19102:5"/> reaſons ought ſo farre to preuaile with me as to withdrawe me from a ſeruice ſo holy, ſo duetifull, and ſo neceſſarie as I iudged this to be. For, as for the examples of ſuch as like not to deale in theſe publike cauſes, I ſawe there were alſo many contrarye preſidents, and that of many worthy men, who in like times had ſtoode in the gap and in the breach againſt the enemie. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Neh.</hi> 4.16.17</note> I conſidered this our time to be like that, wherof we read in the booke of Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, wherein becauſe of the often and hot charges of theſe Samaritanes, enuying the rayſing vp againe of the new Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, out of the ruines wherin they had ioy to ſee it, we are conſtrayned ſo to buylde it as we may ſtand alſo redy armed to make head againſt the enemie, and to beate him backe when he ſhal aſſayle vs. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the learned will ſee to be no matter of game and ſtriuing for the golden pen, but a neceſſarye ſeruice of God and his church, I hope they will be ſatiſfied better with that which may bee ſure for defence then faire for ſhewe. But chieflye this is my hope of all your H. both for the graue wiſdome God hath endued you with, and for the accuſtomed fauour you are wont to ſhewe to all ſuch as to their power doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19102:5"/> faithfully to ſerue the Lord. As for the enemie, I know in deede his malice is bitter, and his pen foule and ſhameful. For ſo both others of them, and eſpecially the defendant of the late cenſure hath notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly teſtified in his wicked ſlaunders of as worthie men as the ſunne hath ſeene anye in this age of their profeſſion. But ſeing it lieth not in vs to make them modeſt and that we are called in good and il report: yea in life and death to ſerue God &amp; his church: I willingly commit any iniurie that may be done me by them for his cauſe, to him to whome the puniſhment thereof apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth,<note place="margin">Iude Epiſt.</note> and who (as <hi>Enoch</hi> prophecied long agoe) commeth with thouſands of his Saintes to doe iuſtice vpon them all, and to reprooue thoſe which are wicked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, of all the deedes which they haue wickedly committed, and all the hard ſpeaches which wicked ſinners haue ſpoken againſt him. Wherefore being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied for theſe doubtes, and knowing no other ſufficient cauſe to the contrary, I haue thought this defence to be my moſt boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den duetie to almightie God, to her moſt excellent M. to your H. and to this whole ſtate and church. Therefore I haue reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by your LL. good fauour (ſeeing no
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19102:6"/> man els ſo long time had vndertaken to deale with this Plaintife) to maintaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him to my ſmall power, the glory of God in the iuſt defence of his trueth, &amp; the honor of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> authority I haue named, in their moſt lawfull proceedings againſt ſuch as vntruely are called Catholiques. Thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing before your H. moſt humbly rendred ſome reſon of this my doing, I come now to ioyne with mine aduerſarie.</p>
            <p>The effecte of this Authours purpoſe, is (as he himſelfe declareth in the beginning of his booke,<note place="margin">The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.</note> and hath béene touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) in preſenting your LL. with the Epiſtle intituled of the perſecution in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande: &amp; with this treatiſe of his own, is to complaine of intollerable extremities v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed agaynſt the pretended Catholiques, for their only conſcience ſake as he affirmeth: and alſo to become ſuter to your Honors in behalfe of their cauſe, that if for the time it may not be receyued as he thinketh it worthy: yet at the leaſt it may not be ſo hardly intreated, as hee woulde make the world beleue it hath beene hetherto. Which their cauſe being not of the thinges of this life wherin reaſon and diſcourſe may trie and diſcerne, but of religion: he ought to haue taken his reaſons to perſwade the

            <p>The reaſons he bringeth are principally two,<note place="margin">Reaſons v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade fauor towardes the Romane catholiques</note> whereof the one is of the puniſhment laide vpon them, and the other of the cauſe wherin they ſtand.

For if it fall out (as by Gods grace I vndertake to ſhow) that the puniſhment and the cauſe is ſuch as that theſe falſly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19102:7"/> Catholiques are dealt with in iuſtice, and that mitigated with great moderation and clemencie: then do theſe with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue their anſwere. Yet ſomething I will anſwere perticularly to theſe reaſons, and firſt to that which is taken of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of thoſe who are puniſhed. In this he alleadgeth that <hi>they are of our owne bloude and Nation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> 
               <hi>and borne ſubiects of the lande.</hi> Wherein what doth hee pleade for them that may not be with as good reaſon brought for all malefactors which the lawe doth puniſh. And to whom els doth the lawe extende but to the borne ſubiectes of this lande, and ſuch as are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalized and enfranchiſed amongſt vs. Therefore if this proofe were good why they ought not to be dealt with according to law, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may al the pryſons be diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and euery malefactor hath by his birth a ſealed pardon for all crimes that he may commit. But he addeth they are not only <hi>Subiectes but alſo duetifull and honeſt.</hi> This dependeth vpon the tryall of their cauſe, which the law according to all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous iuſtice hauing condemned as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie ſuch puniſhment as it layeth vpon them: His priuate and vniuſt clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe of them for good and obedient,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19102:8"/> yea <hi>(readie to die at her Maieſties feete, and for your H.)</hi> can not be ſufficient. Which teſtimonie, would to God it might be truely geuen to them all. Then ſurely there would be more hope to reclaim them to obedience vnto God, and to her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But notwithſtanding it be true, that there are a number of thoſe which are mis led in their ignorance to the lyking of ſuperſtition, otherwiſe duetifull, at the leaſt in outward ſhew hetherto: yet the vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſound and trayterous hearts of a number alſo, haue bene diſcouered in the rebellions in the North and in Ireland: yea further alſo by manifold practiſes both againſt the whole ſtate, and the Royall perſon of her M. and of ſundry of your H. Whereof cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine profe hath bene made both heretofore and of late, aſwell in the K. Bench, by the iuſt conuiction and condemnation of the traytors there arraigned, al pretended Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes, Ieſuites and Prieſtes: as alſo at Chenſforde in Eſſex by like ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prieſt.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19102:8"/> euen to remember. Whereunto ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the doubtful anſweres and obſtinate ſilence that commonly are made and vſed by ſuch as haue had this interrogatory mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred vnto them: <hi>Whether in caſe of the Popes commandement, and the threatning of his excommunication to the contrary, they woulde take armes with him, or any ſent by him againſt hir M. or with her H. agaynſt the Pope:</hi> we may worthely feare what affection of loyal duetie &amp; obedience may be in many of the reſt which haue not yet beene demaunded that queſtion. And in deeede it can not be that ſuch of them as haue the Roman faith not in ignorance but in ſome knowledge of the treaſonnable grounds it reſteth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without denial of the Pope to be Gods vicar, and of all their holies, ſhould be faith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful Subiectes to her H. and this ſtate, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byding as it doth by the grace of God, in the true profeſſion of the Goſpel. Therfore it is not inough to ſay, it is onely their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in religion they ſtand in, to prooue them good and loyall ſubiects. For though euery profeſſion of religion doe not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe the ſtate they are vnder, maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning another Religion, yet there are alſo ſome profeſſions which can in no ſort bee
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19102:9"/> permitted by authoritie, without the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ouerthrowe and ruine of the ſtate where it is allowed. The profeſſion of the goſpell may be tollerated by any prince or ſtate in the world without any daunger to them. For our doctrine holdeth nothing that may impugne their lawfull right and authoritie, but contrariwiſe teacheth all due honour and obedience to be giuen to them, and that for conſcience ſake. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both they maye ſuffer the excercyſe of it without daunger, yea to the greate eſtabliſhing of their ſtates and thrones in aſſurance, and conſequently alſo ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors maye be faythfull and loyall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, yea euen to heathen princes: as the Apoſtles and the fathers of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church were. But an Anabaptiſt that holdeth there ought to bee no magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, though he allege a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d times he ſtandeth but for his conſcience &amp; religion: yet bycauſe his conſcience and religion is ſuch, as the principles and grounds of it are contrarie to all States and authority, the magiſtrate cannot endure ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and religion without the certaine daunger of hauing the mace and ſcepter wroong out of his hands. Much like to this is the cauſe of our pretended catholickes.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19102:9"/> For notwitſtanding they allowe of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates &amp; of authoritie in generall, yet I ſay they hold a faith and doctrine the maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maes and rules whereof are as oppoſite to the preſent ſtate of this lande in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, as are the principles of the Anabaptiſts againſt all eſtate and dignitie. The proofe whereof is manifeſt in theſe two pointes. The firſt is that the ſtate nowe eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed within this realme, profeſſeth by the gracious goodnes of almighty God the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of him according to the truth of the goſpell, and agreeably hereunto, that the lawfull heyres of the crowne of this noble land are ſouerayne in their eſtate and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, to ſee all cauſes and perſons within their kingdome and dominion both eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall and ciuil ordred and gouerned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the commandementes of God without ſubiection to any forren power of prince or prieſt whatſoeuer. The ſecond is that euerie one of the pretended catholique and Romaine faith vpon paine of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to beleeue the B. of Roome (who is a forreyne prince and Prelate to vs) to haue ſupreame authoritie ouer all the church of Chriſt as his generall vicar vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, and conſequentlie to beleeue, that the K. and Q. of this noble land are to bee
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19102:10"/> ſubiect vnto him, to receiue that religion which he wil deliuer them, to obey his cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo far as that in caſe of his excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating &amp; depriuing of them, they are to leaue their crowne to an other. Yea fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that (as abſolued from their othe and allegeance) at his commaundement the naturall and ſworne ſubiects ought to put ſuch his ſentence of depriuation in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt their liege and naturall prince. Which two points being ſo contrarie the one to the other, how is it poſſible that any of theſe Romaine Catholickes knowing and beleeuing particularlye this point of their doctrine, can be a true and a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Subiect to our Soueraigne Ladye ELIZABETH, againſt whom ſuch moſt vnlawfull and wicked ſentence hath bene already by two of their Popes pronounced and ſought by all meanes to be put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. Which things well conſidered, I doubt not but your LL. ſee it to be great wiſedome not to proue their fidelitie in a kingdome, and ſo rare a iewell as hir ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties perſon is, for all their flattering ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of being ready to ſpend their life and their goods in hir quarrell: but rather to keepe a vigilant and ielous eye open ouer them night and day, that they may not bee
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19102:10"/> able (how willing ſoeuer they would be) to do any thing to the annoyance of her royal perſon, and of this noble ſtate &amp; kingdome. Wherfore as touching their perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s though they be the naturall ſubiectes of this ſtate, yet if they offend the godlie lawes thereof in refuſing to ſerue God with vs, &amp; ſo much more if they ſhall alſo declare themſelues vnnaturall &amp; Romaine both in allegeance and religion, there is no cauſe by the word of God why in reſpect thereof they ſhould not be dealt with by the lawfull Magiſtrat ordained of God for the puniſhment of all offenders, according to the lawe prouided in this behalfe. And thus much for the perſons.</p>
            <p>Now for the end. He denyeth your LL. <hi>ſhall euer attaine to that you pretende,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Reaſons anſwered.</note> 
               <hi>by this puniſhment,</hi> (that is to bring ſuch Catholiques to conformitie in matters of religion) but rather be further off. The reaſon whereof he addeth, that ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrainte to do againſt their conſcience and iudgement <hi>(whereby he ſaith they muſt be tryed at the latter day)</hi> is the <hi>loſſe of their ſoules, the memorie of which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie can not but breede a deepe greefe and deteſtation of the thing they may haue beene ſo forced vnto.</hi> But his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19102:11"/> reaſon ſhall be after conſidered. Firſt let vs weigh, that he determineth no good will to be done vpon them by any puniſhment. Experience in deed hath declared it to bee too true in ſome, yet no man can iuſtly ſay therefore, that there is no vſe of puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For both many others hereby are kept in duety, that they do not in like ſorte fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and who can tell what it may pleaſe God to worke euen in them hereafter by this meanes, which haue not yet profited by it. Sure I am it hath done good to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in times paſt, who by this meanes haue beene recouered from their vnduetiful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, vnto a godly reformation. And the authoritie amongſt vs, doing like duety vpon the ſame commandement of God, to puniſh the obſtinat Heritike and Idolater: what reaſon is there, why we ſhould not hope of like effect and fruit of it now, that hath come of it at other times. To let for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times paſſe vnder the K. of <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Iſraell, Auſten</hi> acknowledgeth often and plainely, that the Diſcipline of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, had bene profitable to many of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>natiſtes. <hi>And if ſaith he, it haue not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited ſome,</hi>
               </hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ep.</hi> 48.</note> 
               <hi>is the medicine to be negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, bicauſe the peſtilent contagion of certaine is incurable?</hi> So likewiſe ſome
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19102:11"/> amongſt vs, thorow the goodnes of God, haue receyued profit by this meanes. But if other ſome for the obſtinat hardnes of their heart that can not repent, will neuer be reclaimed, is the meanes therefore to be neglected which may be profitable to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? As for the reaſon he addeth, that to be conſtrayned to doe <hi>againſt their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, doth make them further off, and more deteſt that which they haue ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,</hi> can not hold in ſuch as receaue profit by the correction of their offence. For they will thinke themſelues moſt bounde to your H. all the dayes of their life, whoſe meanes herein God hath vſed, to bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the horrible darkenes and ſhadowe of death, wherein they ſate before, into the Goſpels moſt glorious and marueylous light. To the reſt if it be not profitable, yet haue your H. done the worthie duetie of Chriſtian Magiſtrates, wherein you may quyetly reſt, and with great comfort. For the Lord requireth nothing but obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of vs, and reſerueth the bleſſing of all good meanes to him ſelfe, to beſtow in ſuch meaſure as ſeemeth beſt to his heauenly will. Thus I would leaue this reaſon, but that there is a worde yet to be added to a ſpeach of conſcience, which this Authour
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19102:12"/> hath boldly ſet down here, that is, that at the latter day a man ſhall be tryed by his conſcience and iudgement, which he refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to this end, to obſtinat ſuch as haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended a liking of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded catholike faith, and a diſlike of ours, as if they offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not by this recuſance, hauing their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſo perſwaded <hi>(the verie grounde of all libertiniſme)</hi> &amp; that authority ſhould not compell them to do y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is againſt their conſcience, for feare of conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning their ſoules, abuſing to this end the places of the Apoſt. in the <hi>2.</hi> &amp; <hi>14.</hi> to the <hi>Rom.</hi> for the <hi>2.</hi> the Apoſtle there doth not affirme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a man ſhall be iudged in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daye by an erroneous conſcience &amp; iudgement, but by a conſcience witneſſing either to clearing or conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning agréeably to the law of God. Which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth both by his word in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he calleth it the law of God written in their hart, &amp; by the whole purpoſe of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> place, which is, to ſhew al both <hi>Iewes &amp; Gentiles</hi> to ſtand condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Lawe of God, the <hi>Iewes</hi> by the law written in tables of ſtone: the <hi>Gentiles</hi> euen w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out that, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame law written in their harts. Wherfore it is vtterly vntrue to affirme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any man ſhal be iudged by his conſcience or iudgement whatſoeuer it be True it is that whatſoeuer a man doth, he ought to do it of an vndoubted faith groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19102:12"/> vpon the word of God, that ſuch his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is pleaſing and acceptable to God in Chriſt: and whatſoeuer he doth otherwiſe is ſinne, becauſe it is not of faith, nor this true perſwaſion of doing wel, which is the plaine meaning of the other place in the <hi>14.</hi> But hereof followeth not, that he that is mis-led by an erroneous conſcience ſhal be iudged and cleared according to it: or that the Chriſtian Magiſtrate ought not to require any lawfull duetie of the ſubiect what conſcience ſoeuer he haue of it, that the doing of ſuch a thing is good or euill. For it is not the erroneous or good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience whereby we ſhall be iudged other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then by all our deedes both good and euill, but it is the lawe of God, againſt which if any man tranſgres, either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly or wilfully, he is made guilty of ſin and ſubiect to the ſentence of condemnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the lawe. Which lawe our recuſantes are conuicted gréeuouſly to offend, becauſe they breake it, in not giuing to God the honour which belongeth vnto him, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing his holy worde and Sacramentes, and with them Chriſt Ieſus and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption offred thereby vnto them, not keeping the Lordes Sabaothes, and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyinge the good commaundement of authoritie, requyring the performance
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19102:13"/> of ſo many holy dueties of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Which ſins though they ignorantly commit, as not knowing that they ſinne in ſuch recuſance, but rather being perſwaded that their ſo doing, is a high ſeruice of God &amp; acceptable vnto him, yet ſhall not their ignorance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them. for the Lord wil ſurely beat eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeruant that doth not his Maſters will,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.18.</note> yea though he know it not: becauſe his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance is not of the creation of God, but of his owne corruption originally drawne from <hi>Adam.</hi> Neyther ſhall this good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent excuſe them any more then the <hi>Iewe,</hi> which ignorantly crucifying Chriſt, and perſecuting the Apoſtles, were perſwaded they did God great ſeruice. For it is obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience that the Lord requireth, which who ſoeuer yealdeth not, vpon what cauſe or pretence ſoeuer, is giltie by the Law. On the other parte, if retayninge ſtill that wicked perſwaſion, that to ioyne with vs in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeruice of God (as it is now eſtabliſhed amongſt vs) is a wicked &amp; a ſinful act, yet notwithſtanding for feare of puniſhment, they conforme themſelues, they offend, and are guilty (though not of ſin againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſt,<note place="margin">Howlet.</note> as ſome late <hi>Puritan Seminariſt</hi> doth affirme) yet of ſinne great and grieuous, not in doing the thing which is lawfull and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19102:13"/> good, but becauſe they do it not well and Chriſtianly, that is in faith and true per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, that ſuch their doing is pleaſing to God, but contrariwiſe condemning it in their heart as vnlawfull, &amp; them ſelues of hipocriſie: ſo that while they dwell in that perſwaſion, they can do nothing that may be acceptable vnto God. Therefore ſuch as are deſirous to pleaſe him, are with prayer to examine this their perſwaſion by the holy ſcriptures: whereby finding (as vndoubtedly they ſhall in due time, whom the Lord will ſaue) that it is not according to god, they ought to chaunge their mindes by true repentance, and then doing the dueties requyred of them in faith, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowledge of pleaſing God in them, their doings ſhalbe godly and acceptable in Chriſt Ieſus. But if they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinew obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat ſtill, yet is not authority to be blamed for compelling them, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noble Kings <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi> and <hi>Ioſia</hi> did commaund and compel the people by ſeueritie of their lawes and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments to ſerue the Lord: what igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and vngodly perſwaſion ſo euer they haue to the contrary. For this duety God requireth at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Magiſtrates hand to whom hee hath not committed his ſword in vaine and in it ſelfe it is ſo neceſſarie, that if this
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19102:14"/> pretence were ſufficient cauſe why men ſhould be reſpected: not onely the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, ſhould become gilty of not doing the duetie which God requireth of them: but alſo no Chriſtian eſtate or pollicie coulde ſtand. For this would ſoone bee euery mans anſwere in caſe of being enioyned any thing concerning God or men, howe holy or iuſt ſo euer it were that did diſlike him, that his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience is againſt it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can be no cauſe by the word of God, after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> procuring of ſuch meanes for their inſtruction by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpell ſincerely &amp; duely preached vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as our Sauiour Chriſt hath appointed for the calling of men from their errors to the knowledge of the truth, why your H. ſhould forbeare eyther to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſo godly a duety of them, or to puniſh the diſobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as their offence may deſerue. At their own peril be it if thorow ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or wilfulnes they take darkenes for light, and light for darkenes. Such commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; puniſhment for diſobedience is not of it ſelfe hurtfull vnto them, but rather greatly profitable: both by telling them what they ought to do, and by threatning and puniſhing the obſtinat: whereby ſome may be wakened more ſeriouſly to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their conſcience, &amp; ſo come to yeald
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19102:14"/> obedience vnto God and to the law. And thus far haue I dealt w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his circumſtances. Now remayn his two other reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which are of ſubſtance and weight in deede in this matter, if he were able to make them good. For the one is a iuſtification of their cauſe, the other a chalenge of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment layd vpon them. But firſt hee bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth her M. iuſtice as extreeme, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping no proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the offence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are charged, and ſecondarily, mayntayneth their cauſe not onely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue no ſuch puniſhment, but to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all fauor. Firſt therefore, I am to examine what he ſayeth agaynſt her M. iuſtice: <hi>You perſecute heauely</hi> (ſaith hee vnto your H.) <hi>and that in ſuch meaſure, as the like hath ſcarce been mentioned in Chriſtianitie before, albeit in ſome poynts more couertly then ſome other did.</hi> This perſecution he ſetteth out after by comparyſon of the diſcipline (as hee wryteth) of the Catholicke church, &amp; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the time of Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> affirming this <hi>perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in all reſpects, far to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount &amp; ouerreach that, &amp; to be both greater &amp; inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parably more greeuous.</hi> To the ſame effect he addeth many other like ſpeeches in the end of his epiſtle which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19102:15"/> there ſhal receiue their anſwere. By which complaint a man would thinke that might worthely be thought ſo, if it exceede ſo far as he affyrmeth that moſt cruell and blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die perſecution of the true Catholicks, and conſtant Martirs of God in Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> time. But of this he geueth occaſion to ſpeake more fully hereafter. Now to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere his moſt vniuſt and ſlaunderous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the iuſtice done vpon them, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this to be tru, wherw<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would charge the preſent State. which I deny, not only becauſe they are no Catholiques, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no puniſhment of them can be proper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly called perſecution, but a iuſt execution of obſtinate heretickes: but alſo, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for meere conſcience, and matter of Religion, no ſuch thing is done, or hath been done to any man ſince her M. moſt peaceable and happy Raigne. Hee complayneth of the rackinges, and ſtretching of their ioyntes, the renting and diſperſing of their bowels, the diſmembring of the partes of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and maketh many ſuch like greeuous complaints. What may be done to ſuch of them as are wilfull and obſtinate ſeducers I leaue to your wiſdomes to conſider. This being true that ſuch are Heretickes. ſeducing and deceiuing in as dangerous
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:19102:15"/> matters for men to be abuſed in, as euer did any Heretickes before them: which both hath beene often heretofore, and may at any time b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But yet I ſay further, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that it is ſo far of that theſe tragicall complaints ſhould be true, that no one of all their Catholickes, for cauſe of his conſcience and religion onely, being no otherwiſe an offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der againſt the lawes hath loſt either life or limme, ſince the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie day of her M. coronation, vntill this time. All which gracious time there hath not beene for recuſance, nor for being at maſſe, nor yet for ſaying maſſe, how often ſoeuer they ſo offend, neither by former Statutes nor thoſe of the laſt Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which they moſt complaine off, any further puniſhment appointed, then of los of libertie and goods. True it is, that her Maieſtye by the Sage aduiſe of youre Honours, and of her whole Nobility and Commons, hath prouyded by lawe for the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of ſuch pretended Catholiques as ſhalbe found gilty of any treaſonnable practiſe againſt her H. eſtate, and perſon: being forced by moſt vrgent cauſes, and many dangerous attempts of theirs, day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19102:16"/> preſſing her thereunto. For conſidering firſt the bloudy reſolution of the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> &amp; the dayly attempts to put it in execution: there was great and moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy cauſe why your H. ſhould ſeeke by all godly prouiſion to preuent their intended miſchiefe. The ſecret and deteſtable decrée of that <hi>Tridentine</hi> conſpiracy againſt God, and againſt his annointed, was to make a League amongſt all the Princes whom they had made drunck with the golden cup of their fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Buch. rerum Scot. lib. <hi>17.</hi>
               </note> to confer their meanes and ioyne all their forces together, to roote out the true profeſſion of the Goſpell, if it were poſſible, out of the earth.

To which their ende they haue hetherto run with ſo vyolent a courſe, as it appeareth neither the feare of God, nor any reſpect of men, which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely holdeth others from ſuch extremities, could reſtrayne them from moſt deſperate actes, and full of all tragicall imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. Chriſtian and Catholique Kinges and States in Stile and Title haue byn

Such hath beene the furye and vyolence wherewith this cauſe hath been carryed. Ciuill warres haue beene kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in all partes where the Goſpell hath beene by any number profeſſed, thorowe their falſe accuſations of moſt duetifull Subiectes, as enemies to the State of their Rulers, to alienate their fauor from them: ſo as there is none of theſe parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> which are next about vs, which hath not beene afire, and ſome are yet wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and conſuming in this flame.

Here alſo I might worthely mention the moſt horrible and barbarous
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:19102:17"/> ſlaughters which they haue committed in the purſuing of their wicked and diueliſh reſolution againſt the goſpel. But to leaue at this time the tragedies which they haue played in other partes by the treaſonnable aſſaultes, and deathes of many famous Princes, and the cruell maſſacrees and butcheries of many thouſandes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: I will remember the reader chiefly of ſuch things as haue beene done by them here at home, and are beſt knowen vnto vs. Wherin, to let paſſe the impriſonment and hard vſage which ſometime they vſed her moſt excellent M. with in the time of her ſiſter, (and now repent them of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then that it was no worſe) and the fires they made in thoſe dayes with the fleſh and bones of their owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen for the truethes ſake, (whereof I ſhall ſpeake by occaſion more fully hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) and ſundry other matters not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly knowen, of plats and attempts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Royall perſon of her M. and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of ſome of your H: I will onely mention certaine euydent and notorious actes, whereby, the depoſition of her H. from her eſtate and dignitie (which from God by her iuſt right and title, and to the great ioy of al her good Subiects, her Grace doth moſt

Whereof was a ſolemne inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; writing called the Popes <hi>Bul,</hi> which was firſt certified by his meſſenger, being an Engliſh prieſt, and after ſet vp here in <hi>London</hi> by an Engliſh Catholick traytor.

Which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the neighbour Princes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occupyed at home, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of making war with ſo mighty a Princes, haue not aduaunced the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to put in execution, the Pope hath from time to time laboured to ſtir vp ſome of her M. own Subiects againſt her, to execute this wicked ſentence vpon her. Hereof aroſe the rebellion in the North, which by the grace of God, and by the meanes of your H. wiſdome was diſappoynted, and iuſt execution done vpon ſome of the Rebels. After this another Pope ſuccéeding in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety his predeceſſor, rayſed of late a new rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> bearing name of his falſly named Holynes, hauing leaders and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19102:18"/> companies at the Popes wages, and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> keyes for their enſigne and vpon their forte, againſt which alſo the ſword of the Lord and of <hi>Gedeon</hi> preuailed. For a third to be raiſed euen in the bowels and hart of this noble land ſundry Engliſh fugitues haue bene entertained of the pope: Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome haue iuſtified theſe inſurections,<note place="margin">Sand. L. <hi>7.</hi> de v. ſib. Monar.

Others are beſtowed in Seminaries, ſome to teach and ſome to learne to ſerue the Pope againſt God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Souerraigne, and againſt their owne Countrie. For which purpoſe, ſo ſoone as they are readie, they are ſent ouer hither to withdraw her Maieſties ſubiectes from the duety they owe to their naturall Prince, and to confeſſe and reconcile them as they terme it, to the obedience of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine power. Which practiſe of confeſſing and reconciling to the Pope in ſecret, your HH. for the excellent wiſedome God hath endued you with, for the preſeruation of her highnes &amp; our whole Church from the mouth of the Lyon that would deuour vs, do euidently ſee to be as dangerous a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19102:19"/> practiſe for the laying of a newe plat of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion as may be deuyſed. Therefore lately vpon theſe and ſuch like greate and neceſſarie cauſes enforcing, it was enacted that ſuch Prieſtes and Catholikes or any other, pretending whatſoeuer they may pretend, as ſhall be conuicted ſo to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſubiectes from our natural Prince, to any forren ſubiection, ſhould be held gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of hye treaſon againſt her Ma. ſtate and dignitie, &amp; executed accordingly. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon you HH. keeping a vigilant and a carefull eye ouer thoſe men, and finding ſome of them giltie of treaſon, both by that and other auncient lawes of this lande, haue in deede cauſed iuſtice notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their pretence, of holy conſcience and religion, according to all law and equitie to be done vpon them. For as other male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors eſcape not the ſeueritie of the lawe, whatſoeuer they may be, or pretended to be, whether Catholikes or of our owne profeſſion, if they be iuſtly conuicted to bee fellons or murderers: ſo likewiſe who ſoeuer by due tryall of the law, hath beene found to be guiltie of treaſon, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they haue bene pretended Catholikes, and ſome of them annoynted Prieſtes, and father <hi>Ieſuites</hi> which they haue boaſted
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19102:19"/> could not be touched, yet haue they béene condemned and executed according to their demerites. This then being the eſtate of the pretended Catholikes this day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, what hoat perſecution is this that he complaineth of, &amp; what numbers are theſe that are perſecuted except all the Catholike Rebels and Traytors, (as <hi>Saunders</hi> doth make his reakoning) and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther malefactors be comprehended in this number? And ſo in deede I graunt, ſome of theſe Catholikes after the qualitie and condition of their offence haue beene dealt with, according to the auncient lawes and cuſtomes of this lande. But this is an accounte voyde of all reaſon, to eſteeme that which is the puniſhment of treaſon, of murder, of felony, and other ſuch like offences to bée laide vpon them, for their religion and conſcience only. Which hath béene hetherto ſo ſpared, as ſome of them being founde guiltie of treaſon and condemned for it, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> declaring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to ſtande ſo affected towardes her highnes touching their obeeience, as they would neyther with the Pope, nor any other take armes againſt her, notwithſtanding they remaine ſtil ſuch as they were for their
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19102:20"/> conſcience and religion, yet thorow her Maieſties exceeding clemency haue obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned pardon after their conuiction of high treaſon. Wherefore ſeing for conſcience of popery onely, no man hath beene touched in life nor member, but onely puniſhed by fine and impriſonment, and that the iuſt execution of Traytors, Rebels, Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, Fellons, be they pretended Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques or whatſoeuer they be, can in no reaſon be termed perſecution: I worthily conclude that the complaint of this accuſer is without all cauſe and reaſon, and his charge and accuſation of the ſtate moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutifull, ſlaunderous, and vniuſt.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe hee will needes call to the remembrance of God and men the bloudy ſinnes of their fathers, ſinnes as redde as crimſin and ſcarlet, that is the fearefull and horrible perſecution of the profeſſors of the Goſpell, and <hi>compare the proceeding of their Catholiques againſt vs, with ours againſt them, both generally in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, and at other times, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in England, in Q. <hi>Maries</hi> daies</hi> and taketh vpon him <hi>to iuſtifie that our dealinges againſt them doe farre ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount their perſecuting of vs, and is incomperable more grieuous:</hi> I muſt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19102:20"/> needes here ſtand a litle to compare them, though it bee in deede a thing in it ſelfe as ſhall appeare, voyde of all reaſon once to enter into the compariſon of them togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. What hath bene done in England a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them ſince the time of her Maieſties raigne, I haue already declared, namely that no one hath yet beene touched in his body for matter of his conſcience onely, being neyther Rebell nor Traytor nor Murderer, nor otherwiſe giltie of crymes capitall and worthie of death by all good Lawes. The ſame is iuſtly to be affirmed of the dayes of that moſt noble Prince of famous memory, for his rare pietie in ſo tender yeares King <hi>Edwarde</hi> the ſixt: her Maieſties worthie Brother, that in the fewe yeares of his happie raigne there was not one of theſe Romaine Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques for onely matter of religion, put to death or any torment of body. Nor before him in the dayes of their renou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Father, King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, were any of their Catholiques put to death, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a fewe, which were executed for the ſupremacie, being a matter of State and not of religion, as hauing no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of grounde for it, in the worde of God, and giuing a dangerous intereſt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19102:21"/> for the Kinges &amp; Quéenes of this Land, to a forreine power. As for other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and States profeſſing the Goſpell, this Authour him ſelfe doth acknowledge their proceedinges againſt them, not to haue béene vnto bloude. Now then let vs in the other part conſider the generall and perticuler proceeding of theſe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Catholikes againſt our brethren, not for any crime of iuſt deſert of death, but onely for their moſt holy faith. Which though I can not here lay out at large, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the argument of ſo many great bookes and volumes as are written of them, yet I may giue the gentle Reader a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall viewe of their bloudy actes, of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall infamie to their pretended Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like profeſſion. The townes of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindall</hi> and <hi>Cabrieres</hi> with <hi>22.</hi> other Townes and Villages, were moſt tira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly deſtroyed, without reſpect of men, women, or children. In <hi>Cabrieres,</hi> a thouſand perſons were ſlaine, whereby ſome eſtimat may be made of the number which might be murdered in the reſt. Of which ſo horrible waſte, and ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent bloud moſt cruelly ſhedde, there was vtterly no other cauſe, but that the godly people of that Countrie had ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19102:21"/> themſelues from the abhominations of the Church of <hi>Roome,</hi> and ſought to ſerue the Lorde according to his worde. Likewiſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> valleyes of <hi>Lucerne Angrogne, S. Mart. Perous</hi> &amp; others, were purſued with hoat perſecution and cruell warres by the inſtigation of the Pope, for many yeares. Both theſe being faithfull and duetifull to their Princes, onely for the godly faith which they profeſſed, were in moſt ſauage and vnnaturall manner perſecuted, and deſtroyed by them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe who were ſlaine in the bloudie warres which they made for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of theire Romane ſuperſtitions in <hi>Germanie</hi> and in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Stories of thoſe countries report ſundrie cruell exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, to haue beene done vpon many faithfull ſeruantes of God, onely for the teſtimonie of the truth. In our owne countrie, ſince the beginning of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſtoring of the knowledg of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpel amongſt vs, &amp; eſpecially in Q. <hi>M.</hi> daies: what hath bene the ſtate of our Church, &amp; what hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enimy laid to our charge? ſurely we were neuer charged with any treaſon, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only cauſe of our perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> refuſing al co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19102:22"/> death of our Sauiour Chriſt and that we refuſed to bowe downe before their Idols and to worſhip them. Theſe and ſuch like matters merely concerning religion, and the true faith of the Goſpell were the thinges which were laide to our charge, and no other. And for theſe cauſes how cruelly they haue vſed vs, all the world can teſtify. For what part of the world hath not hard of our Sufferings, and the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and fiery wrath wherewith the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie perſecuted vs for no other cauſe then for the Goſpels ſake.

Thus being prouoked by mine aduerſary, I haue briefly touched and in generall, the tyrannous and bloudy actes of this cruell generation. For the more full declaration whereof, I muſt referre the gentle Reader to the ſtories of the ſeuerall Countreys,

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:19102:26"/> namely to the <hi>6.</hi> and <hi>9.</hi> Chapters of the Spaniſh Inquiſition, where he ſhall ſee what cloſe pryſons, what ſpare and loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome dyet, what ſtrange and barbarous extremities are vſed by them. The laſt poynt of the comparyſon of vſage, is in the execution of death, which hee ſayth hath beene done of their part in all fauor: for iuſt reproofe wherof, let the gentle Reader looke ouer the Storie of D. <hi>Tayler,</hi> who being cruelly vſed all the way he went to execution, there being ready for it, was ſtroken a great ſtroke vpon the head with a waſter, and hurt againe with a fagot caſt at him, which light vpon his head, &amp; brake his face that the bloud ran downe, after ſtricken vpon the lips, and laſt of all ſo ſmitten with a Halbard, that hys braynes fell out.</p>

Therefore I referre the reader to the bookes themſelues, namely to the <hi>12. <hi>chap.</hi>
               </hi> of the <hi>Spaniſh Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</hi> Only two examples I will ſet down for a ſhewe, one of more auncient time and the other of verie late. In the low Countries at <hi>Tourney, Bertram</hi> a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous profeſſor of the Goſpell, found ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, as this man ſpeaketh in his executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: that after many rackings and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes before, he had his right hande and foot preſſed and miſhapen with hot irons, his tongue cut of, his mouth ſtopt with a ball of iron, his body let vp and downe to the fire till it was burned to aſhes, which were caſt into the riuer. Of late in the yeare <hi>1581.</hi> at <hi>Roome, Atkines</hi> an Engliſh man, a zealous profeſſor of the Goſpell for a like matter as <hi>Bertrames</hi> was before, (which was the taking of their maſſe Idol from their altar and throwing it vpon the ground) had this fauour ſhewed him in his execution, that al the way he went to it (as it is reported by ſuch as ſaw it) there were foure did nothing but thruſt at his naked body with burning Torches, and by a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:19102:27"/> deuiſe for the purpoſe was burned, ſo as his legges were burned firſt that the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes might feede their eyes with a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſpectacle of ſo ſtrange tormentes of the conſtant Martyr &amp; witneſſe of Chriſt, this hath bene their execution w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al fauour. Thus we ſee the chaſtiſement layd vpon them, is the rod of a tender &amp; moſt louing mother, correcting her obſtinate ſonnes to bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to her obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; duety: but they haue beaten the true church of God with Scorpions, &amp; as the Sirians did to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites in <hi>Galaad,</hi> they haue threſhed it with flayles of yron.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19102:28"/> be founde in deede there is no compariſon but for this reaſon, becauſe the numbers of ſuch of ours as haue ſuffered, haue bene a thouſand to one of theirs, the perſons of greater ſtate both for birth and calling, the vſage, ſo farre diuers, both in the time of impriſonment, and in the execution, that we in our moſt iuſt &amp; lawful puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, haue contayned our ſelues within the bondes of Chriſtian lenitie and mekenes, nay I may truly ſay, that in ſome obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and buyſie ſeducers wee haue beene ſhort of duty. But they in their moſt wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ful and tyrannical perſecution of vs, haue matched if not exceeded the moſt ſauage cruelties, that euer were heard off amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the Barbarians and the Heathen. And thus much for anſwere to the compariſon, wherein I doubt not but it eaſily appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to all indifferent readers, howe farre vnlike their doings are to ours.</p>
            <p>It followeth now to examine whether of vs can render better reaſon of ſuch our proceedinge. This Aduocate iuſtifieth theirs by two ſpeciall arguments, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the firſt is the authoritie whereby they proceeded againſt vs, which he ſaith, was an ancient generall law, meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the lawe of putting Heretikes to death,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19102:28"/> wheras we haue only new nationall ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuts as hee ſaith, to puniſh them by. For the lawe of putting heretikes to death, I graunt it to haue beene a generall and ancient law amongſt Gods people, when the Magiſtrates haue béene of the faith of the Church. And as it is auncient and generall, ſo hath it good warrant of the word of God. For the Magiſtrate beareth not the ſworde in vaine, but is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Gods iuſtice and vengeance vpon all offendors according to the qualitie of their offence. Further alſo heretikes aboue all other offenders, moſt grieuouſly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, both againſt God, whoſe holy ſeruice and honour they prophane, and alſo againſt men, whom they by poyſoning of the heauenly doctrine doe deſtroy with death euerlaſting. Both which being ſo cleare as they need no further proofe: it muſt needes followe that the Magiſtrate ought to put an Heritike to death. And thus was it expreſly commaunded in the lawe of <hi>Moſes,</hi>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Foure Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the aduerſary for their cauſe.</note>The difference hee noteth is in foure poyntes, whereof two, which are the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie and vniuerſallitie of their faith, he doth but lightly touch by the way, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two of vnitie and pollicie, he diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth off more at larg.

But I put the caſe our Forefathers had neuer had other Religion in England, were this a ſuffycient reaſon to prooue it good? If it be, then many ſuperſticious abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Heathen may be iuſtified and acknowledged good Religion. The curſed falſe worſhip of <hi>Mahomet</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> hath contynued as long as the Idolatrous ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition of the Church of <hi>Roome:</hi> yet were it vtterly impertinent for the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie liuing this day in thoſe partes to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge this reaſon, that it is the onely reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of their forefathers in <hi>Aſia.</hi> When the Apoſtles came preaching the Goſpel to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they had bene a people in the ages &amp; generations before that time in reſpect of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true knowledge of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neglected &amp; not regarded of God,<note place="margin">

Yet was this no ſufficient cauſe to continue in it ſtill, and deſpiſe the Goſpell as a newe faith. Which though it had not beene vouchſafed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before, yet was more aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient then their wicked ſuperſtitions. Contrariwiſe it was fit for them, the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they had lyen in darkeneſſe and in the vale of the ſhadowe of death, with ſo much more ioy to ſee and beholde the Sunne, when it beganne to riſe in their countries. Euen ſo notwithſtanding it were true that darkenes had couered this lande in all the time of our forefathers, yet now that we their children haue the fauour to ſee this glorious Sunne to riſe in our horizon, and to ſee his comming forth like the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming forth of a Bridegrome out of his chamber,<note place="margin">

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19102:32"/> and our owne happineſſe, whoſe eyes doe ſee the light of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the glory of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell,</hi> &amp; whoſe eares do heare the wiſedome y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is greater then <hi>Salamons.</hi> Thinges which in deede many of our forefathers eſpecially in ſome late hundred yeares, haue not ſene nor heard, and wee nowe by the grace of God, doe ſee and heare them.</p>
            <p>The ſame may be ſaide of their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallitie, namely that firſt it is not true,<note place="margin">Anſwere to the 2. gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallitie.</note> that this their faith was left vs by the generall conſent of all Chriſtendome, and then that generality in it ſelfe ſufficeth not to proue religion good. For the firſt it is manifeſt by the holy ſcriptures, that the Apoſtles who as it appeareth by their writinges, preached the doctrine which wee profeſſe, neuer taught their ſuperſtition, hauing left vs no one poynt of all that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly their faith, and wherein they differ from vs. The auncient fathers teſtify (I ſpeake of the moſt auncient of them) ſuch partes of Chriſtendome as they liued and taught in, to haue belieued no ſuch faith. The Stories of the Church make mention of Chriſtian Churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and in <hi>Afrike,</hi> and ſome partes of <hi>Europe</hi> alſo, which neuer receyued the faith of the Church of <hi>Roome</hi> that is, that which is
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:19102:33"/> properly the Romiſh faith and wherein it diſſenteth from vs: as neyther their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie nor Idolatrie, nor ſundrie ſuch other poyntes which are the beautie and crowne of popery. Therefore it is vntrue that they haue it left them by a general co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Further all generalitie in it ſelfe, is not ſufficient to iuſtify a matter of faith. What hath bene, and yet is more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall in the world, then <hi>Mahometiſme</hi> and <hi>Paganiſme</hi> which yet Chriſtian men for all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> generalitie of it, do worthily according to Gods worde deteſt and abhorre. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral conſent of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole Church, I meane of all the holy aſſemblies which at the ſame time in all the worlde profeſſe by publike miniſterie Chriſtian religion, as a moſt graue &amp; reuerent teſtimony, ought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily to be regarded by all her modeſt and humble children: Yet becauſe it may bee ſubiect to error in ſome poynt, yea moſt ſubſtantiall and materiall poyntes (as the experience of the apoſtaſie which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle prophecied off doth ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly declare) euen y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> can be no ſufficient warrant of the truth. Only y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> written word of God, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, which alone hath this prerogatiue aboue all creatures, to certifie &amp; aſſure our conſciences in matters of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:19102:33"/> we being taught the faith which wee haue belieued (as wee are readie thorowe the grace of God to make good at all times before all men,) our faith can not be any newe or perticuler opinion, as he wrongfully chargeth it, but is the auncient and generall faith of the Church, which hath teſtimony giuen vnto it by the lawe, and by al the Prophets which ſpake from <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Samuell,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.24.</note> and thoſe which folowed after. Theſe are auncient Fathers in deede, whoſe heades are all white as woll. In compariſon of whom the fathers they boaſt off haue neuer a one of them a graye haire vpon his heade, they may ſeeme to haue beene borne but yeſterdaye. In which reſpect according to the Lawe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Leuit.</hi> 19.32</note> they are to riſe vp and giue place and doe their duetie to theſe who are aged Fathers in deede. For where as ſimply there is nothing aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient but that which is euerlaſting, and all other thinges are auncient in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and in compariſon of that which is yonger: Wee moſt truly affirme our faith to be ſo farre more auncient then theirs, as that for euery hundreth yeares their doctrine is olde, which at this day the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19102:34"/> Church of <hi>Roome</hi> teacheth, that which our Churches profeſſe is auncient, <hi>1000.</hi> as being the faith of the righteouſnes of God witneſſed vnto by the lawe and by the Prophetes. Therefore if it had neuer bene heard of in England before, and though it haue beene condemned by that vngodly <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> and his ſucceſſor of like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21</note> and their folowers, as Chriſt was by <hi>Caiphas,</hi> and the Apoſtles by <hi>Annas</hi> and his whole conſiſtory, yet remaineth it ſtill, and ſhall remaine for euer, no newe nor perticuler opinion, but the auncient and generall faith of the Church, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall and propheticall doctrine whereby in all partes of the world haue beene and ſhall be ſaued whoſoeuer were appoynted to euerlaſting life. For which cauſe god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath it beene procured by your HH. and eſtabliſhed by her highneſſe authoritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, as was the obedience of the lawe by <hi>Ioſias,</hi> when it was founde after that it had beene loſt by negligence of the prieſtes for certaine yeares. In like ſort the true Goſpell being found againe which had beene loſt by the negligence of their Prieſtes, (if not alſo by their malice and for the furtherance of their pompe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19102:34"/> and riches which it ſerued not for) hath beene in deed aduiſed by the right Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend <hi>Synod</hi> of the miniſterie of this our whole Nation, and reſtored to his former &amp; auncient authoritie, by the high Court of Parliament, enacting &amp; ordeyning by ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the approbation and allowance of it. Which if it haue bene done as here he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playneth without tryall or diſputation, and confuting of the aduerſary openly, the blame is to be laide vpon none but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. For who can make a coward to fight: he may be challenged, hee may haue his day appoynted, and by ſome meanes be brought into the fielde: but if his heart ſhall faile him when he ſeeth his enimie in the face, and that the euill quarrell he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in, doth take away his courage, ſo that he yeeld himſelfe to the pleaſure of his aduerſary without ſtriking of any ſtroke: hath he after any reaſon to complayne that he was not fought withall? Euen ſo it is not vnknowne to your HH. and to this whole ſtate, that our aduerſaries were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to diſputation, and the day appoynted, at which alſo they came, as if they would haue diſputed: but belike conſidering there is no wiſedome againſt the Lord, nor po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer that can preuaile againſt his truth,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19102:35"/> they began to picke quarrels to auoyde the brunt of the battell and forſooke the fielde refuſing to diſpute. Our reuerend Fathers of worthie memory <hi>Cranmer, Ridley, Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> &amp;c. dealt not ſo with them in Q. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> dayes, but encountred with them, both in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conuocation houſe, &amp; alſo at <hi>Oxford</hi> to their ſhamefull foyle, and iuſt reproch, howſoeuer after they hauing the lawe in their owne handes, did moſt vniuſt and cruell execution vpon them, by burning them in the fire. An argument voyde of all reaſon and full of vyolence and wrong, which yet by the grace of God, they fully anſwered, receyuing vertue from aboue, and being fortified with an heroicall mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimitie and a moſt chriſtian and noble ſpirit, whereby they endured the cruell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the flaming fire with great pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and comfort reioycing, they were vouchſafed not onely to belieue, but alſo to ſuffer and that vnto death, and ſo cruel a death for the teſtimony of the Lord Ieſu, and the witneſſe of his truth. And yet theſe men (according to the Prouerbe that he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> flyeth may fight againe) not being aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that men ſhould remember the foyle of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> day, when they were not able to ſtand with thoſe who were appoynted to diſpute
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19102:35"/> with them: now as if they had gotten new hart of grace &amp; ſome good armor of proofe, which euen the verie word of God, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſword, wherby we fight againſt theſe men, were not able to pearce; haue nothing in their mouthes nor in their pennes, but diſputation, whereof if they came to it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine as their late cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plan did, I doubt not but they would haue ſoone inough. But of this I haue ocaſion to ſpeak more herafter. Now let vs proceede to his other reaſons.</p>
            <p>The other two reaſons which are deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him more at large, are of vnity and pollicie, both which he affirmeth to bee in their religion, &amp; denyeth to be in ours. For vnitie I ſay, as in the other, that neyther if they had y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vnitie &amp; agreement amongſt themſelues, wherof they boaſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were thereby ſufficiently warranted, and then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue it not. Of the other part, that in ours, is the true vnitie which is in veritie. For the firſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is no ſufficient proofe, of the goodneſſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter wherein they agree, it may eaſily appeare, for that al malefactors haue a kinde of agréement. So likewiſe haue the enimies of the Goſpel of Chriſt, as the Apoſtles out of the <hi>2.</hi> Pſal. declare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the <hi>Iewes</hi> &amp; the <hi>Romaines</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent enimies of Chriſt, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Gentiles</hi> &amp; the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19102:36"/> people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtate ciuil &amp; eccleſiaſticall did al agrée &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpire together againſt God &amp; againſt his annointed. Therfore except he can proue that faith wherein they agree, to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true &amp; ancient faith of Gods Church, his vnity is nothing but a conſpiracie, and their hye conſiſtory as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſtory of the hie prieſts, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>federat together againſt Chriſt, and againſt his Apoſtles, or as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t betwene <hi>Core, Dathan</hi> &amp; <hi>Abiram</hi> with their rebellious companies, againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> Further I ſay, their Church is ſo farre off from that vnitie and agreement which he boaſteth off, that contrarywiſe it hath beene, and is full of contentions and controuerſies. Which if we conſider, in the publike ſtate of their Church, is moſt manifeſt in the infinit varietie &amp; difference of Saintes, &amp; meanes of ſaluation choſen to worſhip and to truſt vnto, by ſundry Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Townes, companies, and perſons, as it liked them beſt. Likewiſe by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Miſſales, Breuiaries, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies vſed amongſt them. Further alſo by their ſundry ſectes of Monkes &amp; Nunnes, which they haue ſo multiplied of late, whereas not many hundred yeares agoe, they had onely the order of <hi>Bennet.</hi> But eſpecially in the Popes counſels, vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:19102:36"/> and brotherhoodes of Monkes and Freers, it appeareth that the Lorde burſt their Church as a veſſell of claye, and an earthen pot ſtricken with a barre of yron into ſo many peeces and fitters, that there ſcarſe remayneth whole any one potſheard ſo big as might ſerue to fetch fire withall. The agreement of the Popes was ſuch about <hi>Formoſus,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for ſome yeares eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pope diſanulled his predeceſſors actes: they condemned one another, yea they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed their cauſe with ſuch bitter mallice (<hi>Platina</hi> their owne writer reporting it) that <hi>Formoſus</hi> was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp after his death, and burned, and his aſhes caſt into the riuer. The ſciſme of two or three Popes at once, which continued ſo many yeares and occupyed all Chriſtian Princes, to the perpetuall infamie of their malitious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes, doth witneſſe to all poſteritie, how farre their Church is from this vnitie they would boaſt off. Further their booke of decrees though <hi>Gratia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> would force them to agree, declareth what contrarie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant ſentences haue beene pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by them in ſundry cauſes and poynts of great importance. And this hath beene the vnitie of the Popes amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues: with others they haue agreed thus.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19102:37"/> They haue moued and mainteyned wars both with Kinges and <hi>Keſars,</hi> and thoſe both <hi>Greeke, French,</hi> and <hi>Germans.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny counſels haue beene excomunicated by them, and they againe by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. Moſt famous and noble Churches haue likewiſe had experience, what bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpirit of contention and diſcorde hath poſſeſſed them. They haue alienated and cleane cut off, the renoumed Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> whereof a great manie were plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with the Apoſtles owne handes. In like manner haue they contended and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with the Churches of <hi>Africa.</hi> And in <hi>Europe</hi> the ſeate of their impietie, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Churches of <hi>Germanye, Fraunce, England, Denmarke,</hi> nor ſondrie other, but haue beene deuided and rent a ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with their quarrels, and in a manner brought to waſte, by meanes of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies they haue had with them, and others rayſed and nouriſhed by them. But eſpecially their owne <hi>Italy,</hi> as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther monumentes, and the pertiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and factions of the <hi>Guelphes,</hi> and <hi>Gibellines</hi> and their preſent eſtate doth witneſſe.</p>
            <p>Moreouer <hi>Clement</hi> the fift maintayned a great contention with the famous v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſitie
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19102:37"/> of <hi>Paris</hi> about his indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And other of them had a great quarrell with the begging Fryers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the order of <hi>Monkery.</hi> And this hath beene the vnitie which the Popes haue had amongſt themſelues, and with others. Their Councels alſo, as being the vnquiet bodie, of ſo reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and contentious a head, haue beene at variance one with annother: as thoſe of <hi>Baſile</hi> and <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and ſondrie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Their Monkes and Fryers haue had greate warres, both amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and with others, both with the Popes themſelues, with the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, and with their cheefe Prelates, as that which they had with <hi>Gad,</hi> with <hi>Clement</hi> the fift, with the vniuerſitie of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Archb. of <hi>Arnach:</hi> with whome they agreed litle better then the Popes Nuntie at <hi>Paris</hi> this laſt yeare agreed with the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> to the moſt ſhamefull reproch of their whole Church.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Canoniſtes</hi> and the Scholemen, byte one another, according to the Apoſtle, till they be conſumed one of another. The Scholemen, they are alſo diuided amongſt themſelues into <hi>Reales</hi> and <hi>Nominals</hi> and

Their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement was like y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which was amongſt the <hi>Babilonians</hi> after the Lorde had ſtriken them with the confuſion of their tongues, that one vnderſtoode not another: and like the diſcorde of the <hi>Madianites,</hi> who thruſt euery man his ſworde into the ſide of his owne Countryman. Which their contentions and debates were of no ſmall matters, but of originall ſinne, of iuſtification by faith, of the certayntie of hope, of the vertue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of Chriſt, of the vertue of Baptiſme, of the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:19102:38"/> of the higher authoritie, of the Pope, or of the Counſels, of the Church, or of the Scripture, of the reſidence of Biſhoppes, and ſuch like. I might here alſo ſhewe howe their doctrine diſagreeth with it ſelfe, one poynt ouerthrowing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but this may ſuffice to rebuke the vanitie of the boaſt of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, and to laye out ſome part of the euidences which I am to ſhew againſt them, to proue that their Church is not that friend, that Doue, that Spouſe of Chriſt, which is but one, whereof they ſo often vaunt: but a contentious and quarrellous company at continuall warres with others and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſt themſelues, as the poſteritie of <hi>Iſmael,</hi> and as the hoſt and tents of <hi>Madian.</hi> Nowe let vs ſee with what diſſention hee can charge our Church in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.

               <hi>Melancton</hi> the ſecond light of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> was giuen of God as a great bleſſing, and helpe to <hi>Luther</hi> in all his battailes, who was faithfull to him, as was <hi>Ionathan</hi> to <hi>Dauid.</hi> He was excellently learned, not onely in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, but alſo in the tongues and ſciences, and generally in all good learning, as appeareth by his worthie labours in them vnto this day.</p>
            <p>For what arte or ſcience was not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed with his learned hand. He fyled the

He lift vp our heads to behold the Starres, &amp; taught vs to looke backe into the times that are paſt. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all good learning receyued helpe of his excellent wit.</p>
            <p>God gaue him a ſoffter and a milder ſpirit, a nature more eaſie to be dealt with, louely and amiable, gratious and curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to all men.

            <p>
               <hi>Luthers</hi> fierie nature needefull for him, being to ſtande in the Front of all the battell, leaſt it ſhould haue beene too hot, was mittigated with a gratious aſpect of this ſweete nature of the other, and a fitte caſt of his temperat beames, for the purpoſe: Whereby hee ſo increaſed the light, and aſwaged the heate of <hi>Luther,</hi> that the Church of God receyued great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by their happy coniunction.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Re.</hi> 3.19.</note> For when <hi>Luthers</hi> vehement ſpirit was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, as was the ſpirit of <hi>Elizeus,</hi> when <hi>Iehoram</hi> came to aſke counſell of him, then <hi>Melanctons</hi> company and

And theſe three worthies of all the Lordes hoſte, at once this weake Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour hath ſpecially choſen to encounter and to deface with contrarietie to them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues, and one with another, putting his truſt as it ſeemeth in this: that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19102:43"/> his ſurmyſed contrarieties ſhould neuer come to be examined.</p>
            <p>The poyntes wherein hee chargeth them with contrarietie, are of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and firſt in generall, of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them: whereof hee affirmeth that <hi>Luther</hi> acknowledged but one, <hi>Caluin</hi> two, <hi>Melancton</hi> three or foure. For <hi>Caluin</hi> I confeſſe, hee ſaith there are but two, and in deede there are neyther more nor leſſe. For a Sacrament being a ſeale of our Communion with Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11.</note> it can not bee ſhewed that our Sauiour Chriſt appoynted any more or leſſe Seales of the righteouſneſſe that is by faith, and our coniunction with him, then onely two, namely Baptiſme and the Supper of the Lorde. Which without any manner of queſtion or difference, is manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to bee the generall iudgement of the Churches profeſſing the Goſpell by the booke of the harmony of the confeſſions of their faith. Which hauing beene long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe exhibited to the ſeuerall Princes of the Countries, ſtates, and kingdomes where theſe Churches are, are nowe of late very profitably publiſhed, to the iuſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiction of all ſuch as ſlaunder the reformed
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:19102:43"/> Churches to be variably diſtracted &amp; rent in ſonder, with infinit differences of faith. For it appeareth by that moſt profitable labor that the Lorde hath knit and vnited them together, with a holy vnitie both ſweete as the oyntment of <hi>Aaron</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo profitable and rich as the due of <hi>Sion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

Wherein the Churches of God agreeing ſo well together, the diuers opinion of a particular man or two, if it were ſo, culd not preiudice their holy vnitie in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith. But how vntrue it is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is here obiected to <hi>Luther</hi> &amp; <hi>Melancton,</hi> will plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be diſcouered. For <hi>Luther</hi> that hee euer helde or taught that there ſhould bee but one Sacrament as the Authour chargeth. I ſay is an vniuſt &amp; ſlaunderous accuſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In the places hee alleadgeth for his proofe in the beginning of his booke, of the <hi>Babilonicall</hi> captiuitie, after the denying of the ſeauen Sacraments, and graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of three, which he there expreſly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, Baptiſme, the Lords Supper,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:19102:44"/> and Penance. His wordes are theſe. Although ſaith hee, if I would ſpeake af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the vſe of the ſcripture, I ſhould haue but one Sacrament, and three Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall ſignes, whereof more largely in his time. By which wordes it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident that <hi>Luther</hi> ment nothing leſſe, then to teach but one Sacrament in that ſenſe wee here ſpeake of a Sacrament, which conteyneth in it, both the ſigne of the Sacrament, or holy thing ſignifyed by it, and alſo the Sacrament or holy thing it ſelfe: for ſuch hee playnely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth three: Baptiſme, the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and Penance. But by one Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, vnderſtandeth the matter and ſubſtance of the ſacramentall ſigns, which is in deede but one, namely our Lorde and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt. Which manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly diſcouereth the ſimplicitie of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, if not hauing redde nor eonſidered the place himſelfe, he vouched it vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the collection of ſome other, or his verie euill conſcience: if knowing this to bee <hi>Luthers</hi> meaning, hee haue ſo wrongfully and vniuſtly ſlaundered him. Thus for one Sacrament, hee hath his anſwere.</p>
            <pb n="85" facs="tcp:19102:44"/>
            <p>Nowe to that hee obiecteth of three or foure. For foure hee cyteth <hi>Melanctons</hi> common places, where <hi>Melancton</hi> hauing named three, Baptiſme, the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and Penance. hee addeth after theſe wordes. It liketh mee moſt, that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinacion alſo bee added, whereunto he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexeth this reaſon: that it is commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of God, and that great promiſe is made to the miniſtry and preaching of the word. For anſwere whereunto it is to be noted, that firſt in the place alledged, hee nameth onely three, then after adioyneth this, that he could like alſo the ordinance of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteries (for the commaundement of God, to ordayne Miniſters, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God to aſſiſt and bleſſe the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of ſuch as are lawfully called) were alſo named a Sacrament. Which impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth as if hee had ſaid, that in ſome ſenſe, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination alſo may be called a Sacrament. Further the confeſſion of <hi>Auſb.</hi> and the Apologie of it, as he truly alledgeth, both endyted by <hi>Melancton,</hi> maketh mention onely of three. Whereby it appeareth, that <hi>Melancton</hi> taught not ſimply foure, but onely three, and that the name of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in ſome ſenſe, might bee attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:19102:45"/> to the fourth: and for teaching ſake, as he ſpeaketh in his Apologie, in the title of the number, &amp; vſe of Sacraments. Where handling this matter, expreſly hee vſeth theſe words, wee doe not thinke it any great matter although ſome for teaching doe otherwiſe number, ſo that they duely keepe the things which are deliuered in the Scriptures, neyther did the auncient Fathers number alwayes the ſame. By which place it appeareth, that <hi>Melancton</hi> (ſo that the holy things, which are left by the ſcripture to bee vſed by vs, bee obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,) eſteemed it not greatly materiall, for the name of a Sacrament, to how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or how fewe of theſe things it were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed, wherein hee leaneth vpon the iudgment of the ancient Fathers, who all agreed not of the certaine number of thoſe things, which ſhoulde bee called by this name.</p>
            <p>It appeareth then that <hi>Melancton,</hi> in this place did not properly call, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Miniſters a Sacrament, but in this freedome and libertie whereof hee ſpeaketh, not binding himſelfe ſtraightly to the ſenſe of the worde, but vſing it as hee thought good, for more plaineneſſe of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:19102:45"/> teaching that which hee would haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. But yet hee will ſay it remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that there are three, by <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Melancton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwere, that it is true that this is the ordinarie ſpeach of them both, when they ſpeake of the number of ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to reakon three, namely Baptiſme,<note place="margin">Luth. de cap. Boh.</note> the Lords Supper, and Penance: but in ſuch ſenſe, as being well conſidered, it ſhal appeare they ſwerue nothing at all from the generall iudgement, of the faith of all our Churches. This I ſhewe by a place of <hi>Luther,</hi> in the ende of his booke of the Captiuitie. Where hauing ſaide before of <hi>Babilon,</hi> that in ſome ſenſe, there are many things which may be called Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, he addeth theſe words, yet properly it hath bene thought good, to call thoſe only Sacramentes which haue promiſes, with ſignes annexed vnto them. The reſt bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not tyed vnto ſignes, are naked promiſes. Whereby it commeth to paſſe, that if wee will ſpeake exactly, there are onely two Sacramentes in the Church of God. Baptiſme, and the Bread: Seeing that in theſe onely, wee ſee both the Signes ordeyned of God, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:19102:46"/> of forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Penance, which I haue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned with theſe two, wanteth a Signe viſible and inſtituted of God, and ſo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forward, to proue againſt the Scoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men by their owne difinition of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which requireth ſuch a viſible ſigne, that Penance can bee no Sacrament. Whereby it appeareth, that when <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and <hi>Melancton</hi> name any more then two, they ſpeake it in a more generall and improper ſignification of the worde. But when they teach exactly, and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the name to no more then the true difinition of a Sacrament doth agree vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that then they hold and teach onely two, that is Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper as <hi>Caluin</hi> doth, &amp; as all the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches doe holde and beleeue. Which may ſuffiſe for an anſwere to his cauell of difference in our Churches, and amongſt theſe learned writers concerning the number of the Sacraments. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond obiection of difference, is of certaine Sacraments in perticuler, and that of two, of Penance, and of orders. Concerning which two, that <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Melancton</hi> ſometime call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Sacraments, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:19102:46"/> not, hee hath his anſwere alreadie, that it is in ſuch ſenſe as they differ not from the vniuerſall iudgement and faith of the Church, or one of them from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which may be his ſufficient anſwere to all the places which to his purpoſe hee alledgeth out of them. As for <hi>Caluin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4.14.18.19.20.</note> that hee ſhould call orders, an vnordinarie Sacrament, it is ſo farre off to proue that he pretendeth, that it confirmeth my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. For <hi>Caluin</hi> ſpeaking of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſheweth that in a generall ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, this name may comprehend all manner of Signes, giuen of God for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſſurance of his promiſe, of which ſort he nameth the Rainebowe, the Fleece of <hi>Gedeon</hi> and ſuch like, but (ſaith hee) I ſpeake here onely of thoſe which are the ordinarie Sacraments of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole church. And a litle after, the Sacraments of the <hi>Iewes</hi> being aboliſhed, two Sacraments are inſtituted in the Church, namely Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, I ſpeake (ſaith hee) of thoſe which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted for the vſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole Church. For as for laying on of handes, whereby the Miniſters are ordayned, as I doe not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly ſuffer it to bee called a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19102:47"/> ſo doe I not number it among the ordinarie Sacraments. Wherin it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that <hi>Melancton</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree betweene themſelues, and both of them with the faith of the Church. Thus all men may ſee that we are not as ſheepe broken out of the fold, ſcattered vpon the Mountaines, and wandering euery one a ſeuerall way in our opinions, nor giddy as it liketh this writer ſlaunderouſly to terme vs: but wee are in the Folde kept carefully vnder one ſheepeheard, vnited in one God, one Lorde, one faith, one Baptiſme, and the ſame hope of life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting: For further proofe whereof, I beſeech the learned reader, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> would be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed to reade y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hermony, of the Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all the Churches which this day make profeſſion of the Goſpell in <hi>Europe.</hi> And thus much for the vnitie amongſt vs, and their bitter, yea and bloudy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention, contrary to that hee boaſteth of themſelues, and ſlaundereth vs.</p>
            <p>Now remayneth the ſecond argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this ſorte, and the laſt of all his proofes of the good policie that is in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery. Which though it bee ſo much more largely laide out then any of the other, as
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:19102:47"/> it ſeemeth to be the principall, and the reſt to haue ſerued but to make the way before it, and to helpe him to vtter this his falſly named wiſedome and pollicie, yet hee will fondly ſeeme to fall into it, by occaſion of hauing named policie once a litle before. But in deed his true reaſon is, that if it were poſſible hee may deceaue your HH. with a name of pollicie and wiſedome: becauſe your HH. being wiſe, haue a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall eye, and as hee ſpeaketh perticuler re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard vnto pollicie. But the graue and deepe iudgement that God hath giuen your HH. wil eaſily diſcouer his pretended policie, to be but a vaine fancy, &amp; cauſe your wiſdoms to abide ſtil immouable in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true, lawfull, &amp; holy wiſedome, which your HH. moſt worthely regard. For who can better priſe and eſteeme ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding gifts more then your LL. who by the vſe thereof, all this happie time of her Ma. raigne, haue found it to bee a moſt neceſſarie and profitable gift, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of a Chriſtian Commonwealth. Which as this Authour &amp; his friends, haue found to their ſmal reioycing, ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duetiful ſubiects acknowledge it to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory of God, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worthy prayſe of your HH. to al poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:19102:48"/> and to our ſingular comfort. For except the Lorde had ſaued vs and made your HH. carefull &amp; wiſe to preuent and diſapoynt their wicked &amp; malicious prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes againſt vs, this State and Church may iuſtly ſay with the Church of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> that now long agoe they had deuoured and ſwallowed vs vp quicke. Therefore as wee haue taſted the ſweet fruit of this principall ſpirit of gouernement, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Lorde hath furniſhed you from aboue: ſo our dayly prayers to God for all your HH. are that hee may dayly more and more enrich your Noble harts, with the true and holy feare of him, with the zealous loue of his Goſpell, with magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimitie and courage, and all other princely and heroicall vertues, fitte for Chriſtian Counſellors, to ſo Chriſtian a Quéene profeſſing the Goſpell, and namely with that true wiſedome which is from aboue, which as the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> teacheth, is firſt pure,<note place="margin">

For as the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſaide to the falſe Prophets and lying Prieſtes of his time, ſo may it bee truly ſaid vnto this

Surely there can bee no true wiſedome in them, which is as S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith from aboue, ſpirituall &amp; of god, but that which is falſly ſo named, and is carnall as the Apoſtle ſaith. Which true wiſedome howſoeuer this Authour boaſteth to bee in their Romaine reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (by a ſweete enchantment of great pollicie to entice whome hee may to a liking of it) yet being well conſidered, it will be found to bee to thoſe that taſt it, nothing but as the fruit of the Tree of knowledge of good &amp; euil, wherewith Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning deceaued <hi>Eue,</hi> &amp; as <hi>S.

            <p>It is not pure as S. <hi>Iames</hi> declareth the heauenly wiſedome to bee, which is pure as the gold that is ſeauen times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyned, but baſe and vile, becauſe it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laied and imbaſed with all earthly and vile reſpectes of their owne gaine and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereunto they pretend in their Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie, pilgrimages, pardons, purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and all other cunning inuentions and politike deuyſes of their religion. No more can it bee ſaide to bee as true wiſedome is by the ſame Apoſtle peaceable, moderate, tractable, full of mercy, and of good fruits, becauſe it is full of Emulation, of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, of contentions, quarrels, reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges not to be pacifyed, and hates neuer to be reconciled, full of bloudy crueltie, and of euery euill worke.

Where our Sauiour Chriſt hath appoynted the word of his Croſſe to bee ſet forth in a ſort like it ſelfe, and the State of his Miniſters to be agreeable thereunto: their wiſedome controlling this for great ſimplicitie haue deuiſed as they ſuppoſe, a wiſer and a more politike way whereby it might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine more fauour and credit, which is to make it ſweete to the outward ſenſes, gorgeous for rich apparrel, ſumpteous for all coſtly furniture, ſtatly and princely for pompe, as repreſenting in it, the image of a kingdome, laſt of all it is not ſincere, but rather full of hipocriſie, becauſe vnder an outwarde appearance of humbleneſſe, and not ſparing of the body: Widowes &amp; Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes houſes were deuoured, Idleneſſe, Pride, Superſtition, Idolatrie, and all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie, was hidden and couered.</p>
            <p>Thus a faire coulor was caſt vpon a fowle Sepulchre of deade and ſtinking bones, and in a cup of golde, the Kings and Princes of the earth were preſented with a poyſoned wyne of all fornication. Which the ſtories of their filthineſſe, of their warres, of their purſuing one another

Therefore it came neuer (howſoeuer hee vaunteth) from our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt the wiſedome of God, nor from his Apoſtles (which true wiſedome onely maketh Commonweales to floriſh) but from vnpure, carnal, profane, and diue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh wits.

               <hi>Salomon,</hi> the royall Patron of all true ſtate and honoure, by wyſedome and vnderſtandynge, by counſell and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimitye, by knowledge and the feare of the Lorde, as by the ſixe ſteppes of hys regall throne which were made for that purpoſe, aſcended into that glorious ſeate, (as it was noted by the Lyons at hys féete on eyther ſide) aboue all Kynges of the earthe, and ſatte hym downe as a Kyng of Kyngs, and Lorde of Lordes. Whoſe glorye ſo ſittynge was ſuche, as he ſéemed to bée a newe <hi>Adam,</hi> reentred into the Paradyſe of God, or as the ſonne of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:19102:56"/> God whoſe glorye in a ſorte was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in him.</p>
            <p>In which example, the Lorde hath ſealed vnto vs the aſſuraunce of the promiſe hée hath made to honor Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which honoure him, and to cauſe the ſtates to proſper and to flouriſhe which builde vpp the Temple of the Lorde, and neglecte not anye thynge which hee hath commaunded, for the furtheraunce and aduauncement of it.</p>
            <p>And as in olde tyme theſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were confirmed in the glorious and happy kyngdome of <hi>Salomon:</hi> So may wée truely acknowledge to the greate glorye of GOD, a notable teſtimonie of the fulfillynge of them in the bleſſed kyngedome of our mooſt noble Queene. whome the Lorde hath ſo wonderfully bleſt to haue as it ſéemeth ſome notable example alſo in theſe dayes to ſeale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne vnto all the worlde the certayne trueth of thys doctrine: <hi>That happie is the King &amp; Prince vvhoſe God is the Lord</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For howe richlye hath the Lorde bleſſed her highnes and her people in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:19102:56"/> compariſon of all the Kinges and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions rounde aboute vs, wyth peace and aboundaunce accordinge to the prayer of the Pſalme for <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> are in all the walles and Palaces of Englande.<note place="margin">Pſal. 122</note>
            </p>
            <p>Such a peace, and ſuch a plentye, as our Fathers neuer knewe, nor our Chronicles reporte to haue beene in the dayes of anye of her Maieſties moſte noble Aunceſtors before her. Our owne Countrye yéeldeth vs aboundance of all thinges that growe at home: and forreine Nations ſerue vs wyth plentye of all commodities abroade. So that what ſoeuer is in the Eaſte, or Weſt, what ſoeuer in a manner is vnder the Poles or betweene them, wée haue it brought vnto vs. Which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuinge ſo manye yeares in ſo calme a peace muſt néedes haue excéedingly enri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched the land with wealth and treaſure.</p>
            <p>The peace of it is miraculous, in ſo greate and longe troubles of all our neighbours about vs, and in ſo manye Plots and practiſes, layd and vndertake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Church of Roome, and the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Children thereof, for the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baunce of our peace.</p>
            <pb n="115" facs="tcp:19102:57"/>
            <p>Further alſo the Lorde hath gyuen her highnes that honoure and glorye that neuer anye of her noble proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitours attayned vnto: whych is in her owne ſo happye eſtate, to ſitte as iudge and honourable arbitratoure of the cauſes and controuerſies of the grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teſt Kynges of <hi>Europe,</hi> and of all her neyghbours, weyinge the Ballaunce as it pleaſeth her.</p>
            <p>And what is the cauſe of all theſe, ſo calme a peace, ſo rich a treaſure and ſo exceedinge greate honoure. Surely the cauſe is the ſame for which the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Kynge <hi>Ezechias</hi> was bleſſed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with ritches and honor.</p>

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:19102:59"/> our Sauiour Chriſt Ieſu. This godly and honourable purpoſe, was continued by hys noble Sonne, the <hi>Ioſiah</hi> of our tyme, and no doubt but had bin perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, to the great ſeruice of God, and edi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fication of the Church, yf the Lord had contynued hys happy raigne amongſte vs. Thys ſo neceſſary act, for the honor of God, and comfort of hys people, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after repealed, hath bin reuiued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne by her highnes. Which being don ſo longe agoo, and nothing remayninge but to appoynt fit men for the purpoſe: the moſte humble ſute of all Iſraell of God in the land is, that a ſeruice ſo holy, ſo profitable, and ſo neceſſarye, may no longer be delayed.</p>
            <p>For incourrageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wherof, I would to God the ſpéeche of <hi>Azariah,</hi> worthy to be written in tables of Gold, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen in the hartes of all, that oughte and myght further thys holy cauſe that he ſpake vnto Kynge <hi>Aſa</hi> &amp; vnto all <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> &amp; <hi>Beniamin:</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, whyle ye haue bene wyth the Lord, the Lorde hath bene wyth you, and if ye will yet ſéeke hym, he wyll be ready for you, but if ye for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake

And no doubt but if ye ſhall yet goe forwardes to doe euery thing which the Lord hath commanded, and ſeeke him wyth all your heart, no doubt I ſay but he will yet more &amp; more enlarge him ſelfe towards you, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe all your good eſtate excéedinglye, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al the world ſhal ſay, what an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arble and happy Nation is this whiche
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:19102:60"/> the Lorde tendereth ſo dearlye, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunceth aboue all the Kingdoms of the World. So ſhall this Doctrine that I am now debating with the enemye, bée made cleare and manyfeſt, that true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygion, can neuer bée daungerous to a Common Wealth, but dooth alwayes cauſe it to proſper and to floriſh, which the Lord our gracious God graunt may be confirmed more and more by our hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pye experience. But the other part, the Lorde turne from hir Maieſtie, from all the Nobles and People of the Land, and teach it them, by the wofull experience of their enimies: w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if you forſake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord you ſhal alſo be abandoned of him, If <hi>Iſarell</hi> bee ſuffered to bee without a teachinge Miniſterie, as it is yet in a great part of the dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; without the ordinary preaching of the Goſpell, then the Lord will puniſh with lyke or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter puniſhment then <hi>Iſrael</hi> was puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed withall. Therfore the Lorde ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then your hands, that they be not féeble, but that they may be ſtrong to build vp that which remayneth, for vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye there is a rewarde for the woorke.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:19102:60"/> Thus returnyng to myne Aduerſaryes moſt wicked and vngodly Paradoxe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, I conclude, that this <hi>Azaria</hi> and <hi>Shemaiah,</hi> this <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> this <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> with the reſt of the Kinges of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Iuda.</hi> this alſo, all the Prophets and Apoſtles teache vs: that godlyneſſe and true Religion eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſheth the ſeates of Princes, &amp; proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the eſtate of all people whiche re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it with that obedience they ought to doo: and contrarywiſe, impietie, and falſe worſhip is the certayne ruyne and curſe of the Nation which dooth imbrace it. And except it were in <hi>Rome,</hi> the Schoole of errour (as one of their owne Poets dooth truly witnes againſt them) and the Temple of hereſie, &amp; of ſuche as haue bene nufled and brought vp in her Seminaries of tares, I think it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hard of, which our pretended Catho. héere would preſume: that Catholiciſme and Poperie tho it be falſe religion, yet ſhould be fit to make a common wealth to floriſhe, or that the Goſpell, tho it bée true (as it is) yet ſhould be cauſe of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite hurts &amp; diſcommodities to the ſtate
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:19102:61"/> where it is receiued.</p>
            <p>But becauſe this is ſo boldly auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched let vs examine the reaſons of this his confident and erronious ſpéech. His proofes are firſt generall, and of this ſort he hath two argumentes. Whereof the firſt is the experience bothe of other Kingdomes and of our owne, which haue beléeued and receiued, this his Romaine Catholike Faith, and haue floriſhed by it. whereunto I aunſwer if it were true that he affirmeth that they had ſo proſpered, yet he faulteth much in affirming that to be the cauſe of their proſperitie which was no cauſe. For that being true which I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie ſufficiently confirmed, that a falſe worſhip and hereſie can neuer be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to any commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth and people: it being no leſſe true (<hi>Moſes,</hi> and Chriſt himſelf being witneſſes) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this <hi>Romain</hi> faith is a falſe worſhip full of ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Idolatrie and full of errour and hereſy. the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> notwithſtanding it were ſo that Kingdomes entertaning this he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie had proſpered for a time, yet ſhould it neuer follow thereof that their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:19102:61"/> had béene the cauſe of their proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie.</p>
            <p>No more then the wicked abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heathen were cauſe why ſome of them haue proſpered for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and that more for honour of a large dominion then euer the Kinge of <hi>Iuda</hi> did. The <hi>Aſſirians</hi> the firſte Monarchie of the world ruled in a manner all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions for many yeares, many Kinges ſuccéedinge one an other in the royall ſeate of <hi>Aſſiria.</hi> After them aroſe the <hi>Perſians</hi> who ſubduing the <hi>Aſſirians,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Monarchie, and raigned like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a ſpace ſuccéeding one an other. Then came y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Grecians</hi> who preuayling againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> made themſelues maiſters of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and almoſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world. Laſt of all the <hi>Romaine</hi> Empire aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the former, ſuccéeded in the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantie, &amp; poſſeſſed it, firſt in <hi>Roome</hi> and after in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> &amp; againe in the Weſt to that decayed eſtate which now remaineth of it, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great <hi>Turke</hi> had ſeaſed vpon <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and all the Eaſt part of the Empire. So <hi>Tamerlan</hi> the <hi>Tartarian</hi> had a time, as alſo many
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:19102:62"/> other horrible Tirantes wherein they proſpered.</p>
            <p>That theſe proſpered for a ſeaſon, he cannot deny, as he accounteth proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, but I think hee wyll not ſay, that the deteſtable profeſſion of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> or the Pagan &amp; Heathen abhominations of the Monarches vnto <hi>Conſtantine</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empyre, were the cauſe of their proſperitie. It is manyfeſt they were not, but rather the cauſe of their finall ruyne and ouerthrow, as not ceaſing to call for vengeance to God, vntil he with his Thunderbolt from Heauen had ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe then? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye this, the goodneſſe of God who dooth good euen to the vnthankfull and vngod<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, who letteth his Rayne to fall-vppon the Féeld of the iuſt and vniuſt, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his Sonne to ſhine vpon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. An other may be, that the Lorde purpoſing to execute his iuſt Iudgements vppon the Kinges of the earth, for their Idolatries, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, violences, murders, adulteries, and all ſuch lyke their impieties, rayſed vp from time to time (as hee dooth alſo
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:19102:62"/> euen vnto this daye) ſome to ſerue him in the execution of his high Iuſtice vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For which cauſe the Lorde doth make ſome Nation to growe ſtronge and mightie as the Okes of the Foreſt, that hee may vſe it for a Staffe in his hande to chaſtice the Nations, Whiche when it hath perfourmed, hee caſteth it into the fire and rayſeth vp another for the conſuming of them. Theſe are the true reaſons, the Lordes mercy and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, which cauſed them for a time to flo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riſh as the Ceder in <hi>Libanus,</hi> which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he cut downe, and ſo grubbed by the Rootes, that the place of many of them is no more to be knowne: and not their wicked Idolatries which the Lorde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes abhorred. euen ſo doo I ſay of all the Kinges that haue receiued Poperie, and haue proſpered for a ſeaſon, that not their Idolatrie and Hereſie, but that the goodneſſe of God, dooing well vnto his enemies, that his Iuſtice to puniſh thoſe that loue not the trueth, was the cauſe of any proſperitie that euer they enioyed. Againe (I ſaye) that if the Bookes bee well looked it wyll eaſily bée
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:19102:63"/> founde, that their pretended Catholike Faith and <hi>Roman</hi> Religion hath beene pernicious to moſt noble ſtates, and in the verye nature of the doctrine, and the practiſe of it is contrarye to the wealth liberty, honour, and authoritye, of any ſtate or kingdome. The Romaine Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre may ſufficiently beare witnes of it. For the Empyre hauinge pitty to ſee that Church créepinge, as it did in the begynning vpon the ground, ſuffered it to growe vp by it and to embrace it: (as the Yuie doth vpon the Oake. as ſome haue well compared it) whereof the Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pyre being amighty trée indede, felt not at firſt any annoyance, but now hath de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clared y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it hath ſucked it in ſuch ſorte, as it hath drawne out all the iuyce and vygure of it, and broughte it nowe to a withered ſtocke, ſcarce able to beare the barren braunches that are vpon it. For by meanes of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating and curſing the Emporors, by gyuing the Empyre to whome it pleaſed them, by forcing warres betweene the houſe of Fraunce and the Empire, and other the noble houſes of Europe, the Pope hath
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:19102:63"/> broughte to paſſe that nowe there is no Emperor at all at Roome but him ſelfe.</p>
            <p>As for other kingdomes in Europe, that haue proſpered, &amp; nowe ſéeme moſt to floriſh: I ſay thereto, it roſe, and ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from other cauſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it is manifeſt by all ſtoryes, that the Popes haue bene the very firebrands to ſet them afyre, ſowing cauſes of warres betwene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, They haue bene the very inſatiable lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of theyr treaſure, which could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be ſatiſfyed. Tyrants that haue op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed not onely the lawfull libertye of the people, but alſo the royall power and aucthority of their Princes, yea of Kinges and Emperors. Wherefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Aſia, Greece, Egypt, Africk, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie</hi> nor anye other haue bene ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne for abandoning that ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neither is it to be feared of any Country that in theſe dayes haue alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and reformed themſelues herein, but the admitting and receiuing of this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition with other wicked Hereſies, or the chaunging it not for better, but for the worſe, the contempt of the worde of God and of his holye doctrine of the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:19102:64"/> Goſpell which euery where impugneth this (as it appeareth by S. Iohn) hath indeede remoued the Candleſticke and the true light from amongſt them, and wyll doe likewiſe from euerye nation y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhall not bringe forth the worthy fruits thereof.</p>
            <p>And thus as many other Nations héer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, ſo it may well bee that both the Countries néere vnto vs, for refuſing to haue Chriſt to raigne ouer them, yea, and al the worlde for the lyke contempt may be plagued with horrible calamy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Theſe may iuſtlye bringe wrath vppon any Nations, not the reforming of Popiſh ſuperſtitions, accordynge to the trueth and ſinceritie of the Goſpell. And thus muche for his experiences of this imagyned proſperitie of Popiſhe States, his fyrſte proofe in this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. Nowe let vs examine his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde reaſon.</p>
            <p>This Argument, is from the cauſe which may make any State to floriſhe whiche hee aleadgeth to bee vnitie, and affirmeth the Churche of <hi>Rome</hi> to haue the meanes to kéepe it, and the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:19102:64"/> of the Goſpell to want both it and the meanes therof.</p>
            <p>Whereunto I anſwer, as to the ſame Argument alleadged before, that not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery agréement and conſent is pleaſing to God, or profitable to men: For there are agréements in Idolatrie, in adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, in robberie, in conſpiracie, in mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and in all iniquitie, which are all odious to God and hatefull to men. and of this ſort is the vnitie that is amongſt them which is no better then a conſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie againſt GOD and his Poeple to mayntaine Hereſie and all iniquitie. but let him ſhew vs a vnitie amongſt them of Brethren not of Freres ſo falſelye called, but of Brethren that are the Sonnes of one heauenlye Father, the heyres annexed with Chriſt, yea and by him alone of that ſame fayth and church pertakers of the ſame Holy worde, doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and Sacraments, and then I will confeſſe that vnytie to bée both pleaſant and profitable, as it is in <hi>133. Pſalme:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that the Lorde hath commaunded his bleſſinge to bée amongſt them euen

            <p>But the meanes of this vnitie, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth theyr Romaine Churche to haue, and denyeth to bee in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that profeſſe the Goſpell. The meanes and cauſes of vnitie he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to be theſe <hi>2.</hi> vnderſtanding ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures accordinge to the expoſſitions of their forefathers, and obeying the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of one ſupreme Paſtor, with the generall councels of Chriſtan Prelates which kéepeth their Church in vnitie: and the contrary cauſes to bée amongſt vs and to rend vs into infinit varitie of oppinions. How it is with vs I will after ſhewe, but firſt how it is with them. The two meanes which he nameth in effect are but one. For if there ariſe queſtion of any expoſition of the fathers who ſhall deciude the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhall not this ſupreme Paſtor of theirs with his generall councell deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine aſwell of the ſence of the fathers as they referre to them th'expoſition of the ſcriptures. No doubt he meaneth (as their ſcholemen write of the Pope) to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:19102:65"/> put all thinges vnder the féete of him that is ſupreme, that he myght be little leſſe, then the Angels crowned with glorye and honoure. Nay they make Angels alſo ſubiect vnto him that at his commaundement they ſhould come downe from heauen to fet ſoules out of Purgatorie and to carrie them vp with them to heauen againe: as if this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Paſtor ſtoode at the toppe of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> ladder, (one of the ſpeciall honours and regalities of our Sauiour Chriſt:) and had the Angels of God diſcendinge downe and aſcendinge vp vnto him and at his commaundement.

To admit euery expoſition made by any father for good and ſound, or euery point of doctrine deliuered by them for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and <hi>Orthodoxe</hi> I thinke, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:19102:66"/> himſelfe wilbe aſhamed to doo it. For there are not a fewe matters in them euen the verye beſt of them contrarie to the expreſſe word of God, euen the Church of <hi>Roome</hi> giuing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. And the fathers themſelues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractinge in their latter yeares that they wrote afore, and ſuch as ſuccéeded correcting, (and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many times iuſtlye) that had beene written by thoſe which were before them.

            <p>It were needels here to repeate the ſentences of the Fathers ſo often alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on our part, wherein they teſtifye that they profite wryting, and wryte ſtyll profiting, that they woulde haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man to reade theyr works as they reade other mens, where they agree wyth the holye Canonicall Scriptures to receiue them, where they diſagrée to leaue them. The reaſon whereof is ſuch as neither the fathers coulde take more neither wee giue more vnto them.

Which age was ſurely a happie and golden age, in reſpect of many excellent wits, which the Lord gaue to his church in thoſe daies much about one time in an age or two togeather.

This holie and memorable example of ſo mightie a prince, and one of her Maieſties moſt noble
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:19102:75"/> Progenitors, maie bee a worthie preſident for her Highneſſe to followe, beyng a thing whiche GOD hath implanted in all noble Natures, if a Houſe, Nation or Kingdome, haue been honourable for any ſpecial vertue whiche hath ſhined in them, to bee carefull to maintaine that honour wonne vnto it. But there was neuer any more noble acte, vertue, nor honour: neither in this nor in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Kingdome or Prince whatſoeuer, that maie be more glorious to the poſteritie that ſhall maintaine it. And no waie ſo fitly can it be maintained, as it maie if it would pleaſe her Maieſtie to vſe her treaſure, her honour and creditt, with all good Princes, profeſſyng the Goſpell (whiche GOD no doubt hath giuen her, for ſuche vſe as he did to Salomon, for the buildyng of his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall houſe, whiche is his Churche) to ſo hie a ſeruice of immortall fame with all poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Wherefore, beyng a matter ſo full of true honour to performe, and ſo worthie for your HH. to procure: I hope and wiſh with all my harte, euen for your HH. ſake, that it may pleaſe GOD to moue and diſpoſe your noble myndes, to take in hande the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation of ſo greate a ſeruice to God and his Churche, and that the Lorde would
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:19102:75"/> vouchſafe your HH. ſo greate fauour, as to be his Speakers in ſuche a cauſe. I would gladly dwell ſtill in this my moſte humble ſute, or the ſute rather of the whole Church of Chriſt, offered to your Lorſhippes by my vnworthie hande: and particulerly callyng vppon you, by the names of the honourable places, which vnder her highneſſe you moſt worthely occupie: moſte humbly beſeeche ſuche of you my good Lordes, whiche haue fauour with her Maieſtis in ſuites, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploye that fauour which GOD hath giuen you with her highneſſe, in this as worthie a ſuite as euer was vndertaken, and ſuche as diffray her roiall charges for the Common ſeruice of the publicke ſtate of the Churche and Kyngdome, or write and ſeale her high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe royall Letters and Pattentes, cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to incourage her Maieſtie to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiyng of ſome parte of her riche treaſure in ſo holy and noble an acte, &amp; to offer chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully your owne ſeruice to the furtheraunce of it. Whiche maie be accoumpted to you of GOD, as the noble giftes beſtowed by the Princes of the Tribes, at the ſettyng vp of the Tabernacle: and againe at the buildyng of the Temple in the tyme of <hi>Dauid.</hi> But becauſe I rather wiſhe your Lordſhippes
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:19102:76"/> giftes ſhould be free cheerefull and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as beyng giuen to the Tabernacle and Temple of God, then ſtrained by importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie of ſuite. Therefore, moſt humblie and earneſtly praiyng God to direct your HH. I leaue and conclude this cauſe, wherevnto by occaſion I haue a little diſgreſſed with this onely woorde, that if you ſhall become the lordes ſpokeſmen in this, the Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu ſhall aboundantly reward you for it, by being your Mediator for the forgiueneſſe of your ſinnes, and the ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your ſoules with God his Father. Thus leauyng this moſte humble ſuite: not of one, nor of a fewe but of the whole Churche of Chriſte vnto your Lordſhipps godly wiſedomes: I now returne againe to make aunſwere to myne aduerſarie. To his former reaſons, without any ſufficient reaſon, that there muſt needes be infinite varieties of ſondrie Sectes and opinions amongeſt vs: He addeth this, that wee make the Temporall Prince heade of all, whiche is oftentymes a child, and maie eaſely bee driuen as the windes ſhall blowe hym. Wherein he doeth vs as greate wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as in the former. For as he vniuſtly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vs there, with not obeiyng any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:19102:76"/> not receiuyng the expoſitions of the Fathers, nor determinations of Councels, who teache obedience to all lawfull Paſtors, and bothe receiue and vſe all other good meanes to the vnderſtandyng of the holie Scriptures, as farre as thei maie ſo helpe vs, and eſpecially of the lawful Councelles and learned Fathers, though wee giue no Paſtour the place of Chriſt, nor any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel or Father, that which is due onely to the word of God. So likewiſe he doeth in this place, chargyng vs to giue to <hi>Caeſar</hi> that whiche is due to GOD. True it is, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the lawfull Kinges &amp; Queenes of this land, in reſpect of any earthly power, to be next and immediatly vnder God, and our Sauiour Chriſt ouer all perſons, and in al cauſes as well Eccleſiaſticall as ciuill ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme heads and gouernours: that by their authoritie all the will and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements of GOD maie bee executed and obeyed. Wherein nothyng leſſe is ment then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from our Sauiour Chriſt any parte of the hye honour and prerogatiue that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth to the Kyng of Heauen: whiche is, to ſubdue our ſpirituall enemies vnder our feete, to animate and quicken the whole
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:19102:77"/> body with his moſt holy Spirite, giuyng life and ſtrength to euery parte and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the bodie, to doe that worke for which it is placed in it, or to rule it otherwiſe then he hath appointed. But the meanyng is to acknowledge in them that iuſt and lawfull authoritie, whiche the Churche of Roome taketh from them, and whiche GOD hath giuen vnto them: and all the noble Kynges of <hi>Iſraell</hi> and <hi>Iuda</hi> did with good right and intereſt exerciſe and inioye. Wee are farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perſwadyng our Princes to take the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cenſures into their handes, a preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for whiche <hi>Vzza</hi> the Kyng was ſtriken with Leaproſie by the hande of God. But yet wee acknowledge as wee ought, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, thei doe not exerciſe, nor maie not exerciſe the office of the Miniſterie in their owne perſones, yet are thei the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenauntes of God to ſee hym worſhipped and obeyed by all perſones, as thei ought to obeye hym, and by puniſhment to force the Tranſgreſſours to the doyng of ſuche duttie as belongeth vnto their places and callyng. And thus we read that <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Sulomon Ezekia, Ioſius,</hi> and other worthie Kynges did. Who reformyng the ſtate of Religion, whiche had been polluted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:19102:77"/> before with ſhamefull Idolatries, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poincted the Prieſtes and Leuites euery one to doe his office, accordyng to his func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and charge. Agreeably whereunto the Apoſtle teacheth, that euery ſoule ought to bee ſubiect to the hyer powers. Whereby it is manifeſt, that he comprehendeth the Miniſters, of what name ſoeuer thei bee as well as others. And our Sauiour Chriſt ſubmittyng hymſelf vnto them, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour is it that ſhould not obeye them: but ſuche a Seruaunt as will be better then his Lorde, and ſuche a Scholler as will bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue his Maiſter. Herein therefore we giue nothyng vnto them but theirs, whiche God the Lorde of all hath beſtowed vpon them. And therefore, if a Childe as <hi>Ioſias</hi> was be Kyng, wee acknowledge and reuerence the authoritie in hym, aſwell as in <hi>Dauid</hi> or <hi>Salomon.</hi> Wherein wee yeelding our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God, and to that authoritie which GOD hath ſett ouer vs, can giue hereby no cauſe of innouations, as he blameth vs, or daungerous hazardes to a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, nor hinder any good meanes of kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng the Churche in a holie vnitie. But monſterous in deede is the heade, whiche thei make, appoinctyng one man ſomety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:19102:78"/> (who often were vnfitte for any little charge) to bee heade and gouernour of all the worlde, and that in all cauſes, bothe Temporall and Spirituall. A thyng with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all compariſon, more vnfitt and abſurde then if a Sculler ſhould bee taken from the Thames, to be made Admirall of all the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean Sea. Nay, a thyng vtterly impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for the infinite varietie of tongues and of cauſes, and the great diſtaunce of places: And what power doe thei attribute to this monſtrous head of the worlde: ſurely, that which thei can not giue without beyng gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of blaſphemie and high Treaſon againſt our Sauiour Chriſte, in makyng common his regalities and honors of giuyng Lawes to the Church, ruling the conſcience, and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng in the middeſt of the Temple of God, with the Vicar of Rome, whiche maie not be attributed neither to any man, of what giftes ſoeuer, nor to any Angell, or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the worlde. Moreouer, thei offende alſo againſt the ſtate of worldlie Princes, withdrawyng their alleagiaunce from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as a nomber of them doe now from her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie to giue it to this head, and raiſing for it many Inſurrections, Rebellions, and Treaſons in the ſtate, and many quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relles,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:19102:78"/> contentions, and Sciſmes in the Churche. Wherefore, ſeyng that the true cauſes of all holie vnitie and agreement are with vs, and not with them: that is, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to God and his holy word, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of free Chriſtian and lawful co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferences, Sinodes and Councelles, and that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of bleſſyng are giuen to the precious faith we holde, and not to their wicked falſe worſhippe: I conclude, that theſe his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſons are vtterly inſufficient, to proue that benefite by meanes of vnitie to bee in their Romiſhe faith for a Commonwealth, whiche he pretendeth, or to diſproue it to be in the Goſpell of our Sauiour Chriſte, which through his grace we profeſſe.</p>
            <p>Now, he proceedeth to particuler com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of a Chiſtian ſtate,<note place="margin">Particuler commondi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to growe to a Common wealth by Poperie.</note> which he ſaith their Religion bryngeth vnto it, and ours the contrary inconueniences, makyng the compariſon in our owne Countrey. Which if I graunted all, yet were not his generall poſition true, that their Religion doeth make a Commonwealth to proſper, and ours doth hinder it, ſufficiently proued. For Idolatrie and Paganiſme maie in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect bryng a commoditie, whiche true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion will not yeelde. Shall wee then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:19102:79"/> Religion by that, whiche in ſome one regarde is beſt for our eaſe, profite and peace. <hi>Ieroboam</hi> perſwaded the tenne Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes by ſuche a like reaſon, to leaue the true Religion whiche GOD had deliuered vnto them by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophetes, and to receiue the worſhippe of the Idolles whiche he had errected, becauſe his Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Religion brought them this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer commoditie, that thei might tarie at home in their houſes, and auoyde greate charge, coſt, and expenſes, in goyng from <hi>Dan</hi> or <hi>Bethel,</hi> the vttermoſt partes of the lande of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> to worſhippe in <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> whereas the other required of them at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine tymes in the yeare, to leaue all they had with greate perrill and daunger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng ſpoyled of all in their abſence, as he would haue had them to think, and to take a greate and coſtly iourney to their ſo greate expenſes and trauaile. Yet was not <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boams</hi> Religion therefore the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and the other falſe, no, nor more profitable for theim. For whether was it more profite to enioye onely for a ſhorte tyme, the eaſe in tariyng at home, and to ſaue the trauaile and coſte of goyng to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> then by obeiyng the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:19102:79"/> of God, in yeeldyng to hym the ſeruice whiche he required to depende v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon hym, and thereby to bee aſſured to haue ſafely kepte, that whiche for the preſent thei enioyed, and to dwell in the lande, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to the promiſe, bothe thei and their poſteritie for euer. Or whether brought theim greater hurte in the ende, true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, whiche required their trauell and coſte to worſhip at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> or <hi>Ieroboa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> Idoll, whiche in the ende did caſte them out of the lande, and their children for euer, leadyng them captiues into <hi>Aſſiria,</hi> and makyng theim ſubiecte to the iuſte puniſhement of euerlaſtyng death. To haue tarried ſtill in <hi>Egipt,</hi> ſeemed to ſome to ſtande better with the wealthe and proſperitie of the people of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> to enioye that thei had gotten there, the ſpace of fower hundred yeres thei had dwelte in it, then with ſo many troubles, carriages of their houſholde ſtuffe, and cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell into ſo huge a deſerte to worſhip there. But the ſeruice of GOD required it, and in the ende it was farre more proffitable for them. For, in ſteede of beeyng ſlaues to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who putt them into their Bricke houſes of Claie, and into their Furnace of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:19102:80"/> Iron, thei obtained a goodlie lande of their owne, where thei dwelte as a free people, euery one ſitting vnder his owne Vine, and drinkyng the water of his owne Well.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> might haue thought it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to haue tarried ſtill in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r</hi> of the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,</hi> then to go thence he knewe not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Yet the obedience of GOD required hym to leaue his owne Countrey, whiche the Idolatrie of his Countrey did not exact of hym. And in the ende not onely in regard of the life to come, but euen of this life it fell out to his farre greater benefite, then if he had not borne that harde condition as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at the firſte, and tarried ſtill. For, after and by this meanes, GOD made <hi>Abraham</hi> a Father of many Nations, his Seede as the Sande of the Sea, and the Starres of heauen in multitude, naie he gaue hym a ſonne, in whom bothe he and all Nations ſhould bee bleſſed. So the Apoſtles were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to leaue all and followe Chriſt, as in ſome ſorte many other oftentymes are likewiſe to doe. A hard Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion would this man ſaie, and ſtandeth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with any reaſon or pollicie, but is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their commoditie and beſt eſtate: yet
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:19102:80"/> is not Chriſtes Religion therefore to bee impugned. For whatſoeuer it requireth, yet is it the onely true Religion, and therefore that whiche onely hath the promiſe of the bleſſyng of God annexed vnto it, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles finally proued, and all ſhall likewiſe proue whiche followe hym.</p>
            <p>It ſemed good policie to ſome of the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of <hi>Iuda,</hi> to be in league with the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie kyng of <hi>Aſſiria,</hi> and to confederate them ſelues with the people of the natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, whiche true Religion did not ſuffer, nor allowe: yet was it not the leſſe the onely true Religion, no, nor had not been in the ende leſſe profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for their ſtate. For if thei had obeyed God, and depended vpon hym, then had thei continewed the Kyngdome in their lande, whereas euen by their pollicie thei were caſte out of it, and deſperſed abroade. Thei had been better to haue contented them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,<note place="margin">Eſa. 8.</note> with the ſofte runnyng and ſhallowe water of Silo, whiche thei ſo muche deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: for then thei had not been carried awaie to Babell. But Euphrates was a goodlie deepe water, a ſwifte flood, a noble ſtreame therefore thei deſired to drinke of it, and to waſhe theim ſelues in it, but to their owne
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:19102:81"/> deſtruction: For this ſtrong ſtreame tooke their feete from them, &amp; carried them awaie into captiuitie. There are many whiche by ſuche wicked pollicies forſlow, yea, neglect the reformation of Superſtition, of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, of Popiſhe abuſes, and enormities of the Churche within their Dominion. Thei are afraied innouations ſhould breede daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to their eſtate, and therefore thei chooſe rather with the indignation of God, to let al alone, and ſuffer a ſtate once eſtabliſhed ſo to continue, then to alter abuſes and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, though GOD and true Religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it. Yet ſhall ſuche pollicies in the ende, be founde to haue no ſound wiſedome in theim, when GOD accordyng to his woorde, ſhall viſite ſuche a Nation, and bee auenged of them for all their impieties. By like reaſon a man that liketh not of chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie becauſe thei muſte ſuffer perſecution, whiche will liue godlie in Chriſt Ieſu, and becauſe the waie is ſtraight and narrowe, maie with as good colour pretende to haue iuſte matter to refuſe it. But chriſtian faithe and the narrowe waie in all holie and ſound wiſedome, are notwithſtandyng to bee cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and the broade waie wherein a man ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:19102:81"/> to walke at his eaſe for a ſeaſon, to be refuſed. For in the ende he ſhall proue it true whiche <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaieth, that there is a waie whiche ſeemeth good vnto a man, the ende whereof is deſtruction, as there are lippes that ſtill Honie, but the feete of the ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die leade into hell. It is therefore meere profauneſſe &amp; Atheiſme, to meaſure religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by euery commoditie, and ſo farre to receiue it, and ſo ofte to chaunge it, as in the vaine diſcourſe of fleſhe and blood it ſeemeth to ſtande, or not to ſtand with our profite. For this is the profane ſpirite of <hi>Eſau,</hi> to make but a pollicie of Religion, and a ſeruaunt to our ſelues. But true Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for it ſelf, becauſe God hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded it, and ſo farre and in ſuche ſorte, as he hath preſcribed, what daungers or diſcommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſoeuer profane infidelitie, and the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe diſcourſe of the naturall man, whiche as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaieth, is poore blinde and can not ſe farre of in theſe matters, ſhall fancie and imagine. Naie, though in deede for triall of our faithe (more precious then gold) and for the honour of his name in our patience, the Lorde ſhould ſee it good, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerciſe his people with ſundrie afflictions,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:19102:82"/> for how ſoeuer for ſuche ſecrete, and yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies iuſte cauſes the Lorde ſhall ſee good to deale with any Nation, yet in the ende if thei ſerue the Lorde, thei ſhall finde it to bee moſte for their comforte, bothe in this life, and in the life to come. And therefore this remaineth alwaies firme, that whatſoeuer the naturall man, and carnall pollicie ſhall iudge, yet true Religion in the groundes of the doctrine, and in the exerciſe and practiſe of it, is not contrary to the floriſhyng eſtate of a commonwealth, but bothe in the nature of it, and by meanes of the promiſe of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyng annexed vnto it, is the Religion, by whiche alone Kyngdomes and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealthes maie truely proſper and floriſhe. Thus wiſhyng to bee vnderſtoode of all men, that Religion is to bee imbraced for Religions ſake, and not for policie, and that therefore, how ſoeuer it pleaſe GOD to deale with thoſe, whiche ſhall receiue it in this life, thei are notwithſtandyng to abide by that truthe, whereby onely their ſoules maie bee ſaued to euerlaſtyng life, and alſo that the doctrine and practiſe of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, bothe by the nature thereof, and by reaſon of the promiſe of bleſſyng annexed
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:19102:82"/> to it aboue, is the only religion which may proſper a K. or common wealth, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no falſe worſhip, what ſhewe ſo euer it may haue of ſome particuler co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity for a ſeaſon, can in trueth and in the end proue commodious to it. I proceede further to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare that he obiecteth of certayne parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular commodities and diſcommodities of our holy faith and their Idolatrous ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt point he dealeth with is of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of goodes wrongfully gotten,</hi>
               <note place="margin">An anſweare to the firſt point of the aduerſaries profitable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine for a common weale.</note> 
               <hi>which their Churche <hi>he ſaith,</hi> teacheth ſo preciſely, as neither by abſolution nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of any Prelate, hee may bee par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned without will of reſtitution: but dying ſo, is eſteemed a reprobate and not prayed for in their Churche.</hi> And this faith hee is their doctrine, the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whereof hee adioyneth, but firſt let vs examyne both our doctrines. That their doctrine and practiſe is ſuch as hee here affirmeth, I deny, for they haue ſundry waies to hinder the actuall reſtitution of goodes wrongfully gotten. Whereof, that is chiefe and principall whiche hee heere denieth of the diſpenſations of the chiefe Prelate, for if his Fatherhoode
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:19102:83"/> may diſpenſe with the ſinnes to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in time to come, and giue a ſealed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don afore the offence (as it is notoriouſly knowen to all the worlde, he taketh vpon him to doe, &amp; if neede be the buls the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues may bee ſhewed, &amp; other moſt ſufficient and ſtrong proofes of it are to be made) then in caſe of any wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g extortion, theft, vſury, bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, Symony, or ſuch like after commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he hath his pardon afore hand, and is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with for it many yeares before hee haue done the deede. Further, he that may diſpenſe with the greater, may ſurely pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the leſſe: but his Fatherhoode taketh vpon him to diſpenſe with greater ſinnes then theſe. for proofe wherof all the world is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tneſſe of his diſpenſation with marriage of the neece, and that he gaue leaue to the brother to marry with his brothers wife. can not hee then diſpence wiih a petilarcin or a bribe? What power they affirme, hee hath herein, appeareth by theyr ſhameleſſe Flatterers, that attribute vnto him pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to diſpenſe with al things, and that what ſoeuer GOD maye geue pardon of, that may hee. As for his owne prophane holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, it is, as the Canons ſay, a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to diſpute of his doynges, whoſe
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:19102:83"/> offences ſayeth the Canon, are to be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as the thefte of the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> the murders of Sampſon, and the inceſt of Lot. If the Pope bee a Theefe or an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioner, and yet to be excuſed as the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites:</hi> then if he diſpenſe with all he maye not bee accuſed. And if his murder and inceſt bee not to bee iudged, who ſhal iudge him for giuing pardon for extortion? Their Canons teache that hee hath full power of God to diſpenſe aboue right and lawe, and make iuſtice of iniuſtice, in chaunging and correcting of rightes. He alone hath the right to take from one, and giue to another, all the worlde is his Dioces, he is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary of all, hauing full and entyre power in thinges ſpirituall and temporall. For he is L. of L. and K. of K. hauing the right of K. ouer his Subiectes. Hee is all, and aboue all, and it is neceſſarye to Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to bee Subiect to the Pope of Rome, ſeeyng y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God &amp; the Pope haue but one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory. I am loth to turne vp this dunghill, and ſuch lyke, the odyous &amp; noyſome ſtinke whereof may infect the worlde, but that as the Prophete ſaith, their owne dung is to be caſte in their faces. What a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and Diueliſhe preſumption is this,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:19102:84"/> to take vppon him theſe things, and yet this man woulde make vs beleeue that no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late can diſpenſe for goodes vniuſtly gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. True it is, that they cannot indeede, but that he taketh vppon him to be able to doe it, is too too manifeſt. For beſides that hath beene alleadged out of the Canons, if wee regard either his dealing in this age or in former times, we ſhal find he hath not onely giuen pardon for the doing of it, but expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded &amp; committed ſuch violent &amp; wrongful oppreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. what part of Europe hath not the Pope oppreſſed with as grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous exactions, as euer <hi>Roboam</hi> did <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el?</hi> His little finger hath been heauier to the people which admitted his tyrannie then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole bodie of any other tyrant. For they haue beaten their people with rods, but he hath ſcourged them with whippes of wyre. Oftentimes both this noble Iſland &amp; other greate ſtates &amp; kingdoms of the Weſt haue groned vnder theſe his burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> did vnder the exactions of <hi>Pharao</hi> &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:19102:84"/> whom he liked to ſpoyle, &amp; beſtowing them vpon who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it pleaſed him: as ſundry exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of the K. of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; of France, yea, &amp; of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperours doe aboundantly teſtifie. yet he wil ſeeme an enemy to thefte, and himſelfe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit ſpoiles &amp; robberies, like thoſe which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pirate obiected to Alexander. The warre for recouery of the holy land, the Pope hath bin Author &amp; incourager of with giuing for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> purpoſe pardons of ſins to al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> would fight in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quarrell, of what an infinitie of warres &amp; vniuſt oppreſſions haue they beene cauſes both in other places &amp; in the Weſt Indies wherby their own ſtory, ſince the inuaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſuch as he hath ſent thither, hath bin partly by warres, &amp; partly by cunning, and crafty dealing, toyling the people with extreame labor to the death, waſted &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumed of that poore and harmles people <hi>1500000.</hi> But theſe warres they will ſay were lawfull, te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to the inlarging of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith of Chriſt: which is cleane contrary. For beſides that if they receaue that faith he bringeth, they ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be litle y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better, if it were indeed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true faith of Chriſt, which they would plant there, yet for that reaſon it were not lawfull to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade a people, with whom there is no cauſe of any other iuſt quarrell.</p>
            <pb n="182" facs="tcp:19102:85"/>
            <p>For God hath as wel determined the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Princes: as he hath the poſſeſſions of priuate me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without which parke wherin they are impaled by him, they may not walk without iuſt cauſe of their neceſſarye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Wherefore this was very bolde that hee durſte affirme no Prelate to haue power to forgiue it. Nay not onelye the Pope taketh this vppon him, but euerye hedge Prieſt will vſurpe a power to doe greater matters then this.</p>
            <p>As for example, the wicked Prieſt that confeſſing that infamous <hi>Iauregui,</hi>
               <note place="margin">As the Abbot here in Eng. did the Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke that poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned K. Iohn.</note> abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him aforehande for the murther hee ſhould haue committed in kylling the moſt Noble and wiſe Prince of Orange. And if they doe this, and the life bee more woorth then the goodes, ſurely they will not doubte to take vppon them to doe the other. Whereby it appeareth not onelye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their doctrine hyndereth by this meanes the reſtitution of goods vnlawfully gotten, but alſo how pernitious it is in generall to al ſtates and common wealths, &amp; what an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy it is to all holines &amp; vertue. For what greater incouragement may there be to ſin the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> impunity, &amp; what more vnaſſurance to a ſtate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al miſchief eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the murders &amp;
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:19102:85"/> execrable attempts againſt K. and P. and may be not onely forgiuen, but alſo encoura<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged with inriching and ennobling of the executioners of ſuch deſperate and dyueliſh actes in this life, and promiſe of the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; all their fathers houſe in the world to come. Whereof I doubt not but your HH. will haue eſpecial regard, ſeeing not onely this &amp; ſuch like hor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rible acts haue been attempted and done by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many worthie princes round about vs, &amp; neere vnto vs, but alſo by that late diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery of like moſt miſchiuous &amp; deteſtable purpoſe againſt her moſt excellent maieſtie, (whom God alwayes preſerue from theyr blooddy hands) by a prieſt of theyrs for that cauſe arraigned, endyghted, adiudged, and executed according to the lawe in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe. Beſides all theſe, what are their cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters &amp; ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctuaries, but euen dens of theeues whereunto whoſoeuer flyeth though he be a bankrupt or felon, a murderer, a traitour, or any malefactor whatſoeuer, yet are they pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tected there ſo as no iuſtice may proceede againſt them.</p>
            <p>The alter of the Lord could not protect Io<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ab, for wiſe K. Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> well vnderſtood y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> god protecteth not offendours from iuſtice,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:19102:86"/> and the ſworde of the magiſtrate: Yet they arrogate this vnto the abhominable alter of their Idoll of bread, yea and to their Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and other ſuch priuileged places. But this may ſuffice to ſhew the doctrine or prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the church of Rome, touching goods wrongfully gotten &amp; the reſtitution of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>If I ſhould ſpeake of their ſimonie, their pluralities, and non reſidences, and all other their practiſes of ſpoyling the people vniuſtly of their goods: It might eaſily bee ſhewed, that from the Pope to the pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, from the B. of Rome, to the begging Fryer, and the ſoule Prieſt, not one but is guiltie of the crime which hee woulde make vs here to beleeue they ſo earneſtly deteſt.</p>
            <p>One the other part our doctrine is that true repentance (without which no offendor is ſaued) doth requyre a hatred of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe committed, whiche can neuer bee in him who deteineth ſtill the vniuſt Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. For if he hated it, hee would as the Prophet exhorteth the Idolaters repenting, to ſay to the garments of theyr Idols, Get thee hence: If they haue the repentance of Dauid in acknowledging their ſinne, and hauing it alwayes as a heauie ſpectacle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: If they heard the noyſe and crie which the beames of the houſes builte
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:19102:86"/> with oppreſſion and blood, doe make one to another, &amp; both of them in the eares of the Lord, they muſt needs be carefull to amend themſelues, &amp; to take out ſuch a beame as may pull downe al the building. And if Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chee reſtore again fourefold according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, ſurely the ſame muſt needs be reſtored, if it be poſſible, or at the leaſt there muſt bee a will of reſtitution. As for not praying for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when they are dead, which he maketh a great note and boaſt of, wee eſteeme, and agreeably to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scripture, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to pray for the dead, is an abuſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of god, &amp; a profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacred part of his holy ſeruice &amp; therfore do not this only for no theeues, but not for the Saints of God being departed out of this life, as hauing neither precept, promiſe, nor example of it.<note place="margin">The commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth that they reape of their practiſe in this behalf, are 2. wherof the firſt is the ſtaying of theſe people fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al iniuſtice</note> 
               <hi>Our practiſe moreouer is ſuch as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue no diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, nor multitude of ſanctuaries to pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tect the wrong doer.</hi> Nowe, therefore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning this firſt point, this being our doc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trin &amp; practiſe w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> hath bin declared, be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For whereas it is due puniſhmente y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> maketh men ſlower to offend, It appeareth that this not beeing w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them they cannot reape the fruite whereof he ſpeaketh: that is, to haue their people ſtayed from extortion, theft, brybery, vſury, ſimony, and ſuch like. And indeed what ſtay there is amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is manifeſt vnto al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtory theyr deeds in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages or take heed to their doings in this preſent time.

               <hi>The ſecond is, their doctrine of the obſeruation of vowes made to god, which they teach being made of thingss lawful honeſt &amp; poſſible, ought to be kept,</hi> If this were their doctrine, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhoulde our doctrine in this point agree, and conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> benefit of it to be reaped aſwell by vs as by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. but their doctrine accounteth the vowes of pilgrimages, of offering to Idols which they call ſaints, &amp; a thouſande ſuche like abhominations, honeſt &amp; lawful vowes, being in deed wicked prophanations of the name &amp; ſeruice of God in this behalf. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they hold y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a vow of perpetual ſingle life, is an honeſt, lawfull, &amp; poſſible vow. but in al ſuch as in their ſingle life ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tein it is neither honeſt nor lawful.

I graunt in ſome, to whome God ſhall vouchſafe it, it may beſo, but God hath made no promiſe to giue anye man that gifte, what exerciſe ſoeuer he vſe to obtaine it.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſuch vowes as hauing beene vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and vndiſcreetely made of perpetuall ſole lyfe by any, not hauing the gift of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; if for a time not hauing it al his life and bynding him to continue in reſtleſſe bur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning and vnquietneſſe, diſtracting him from all his buſineſſe, and diſabling him from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any acceptable ſeruice to God or men, but flaming in his luſtes, and defyling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually his ſoule and his bodye with diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable thoughtes and deedes: We af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme in deede that ſuch vowes hauing been raſhly vnaduiſedly and vngodly made, ought diſcreetly and godly to be broken, that the lawefull remedy appoynted of God being vſed, he may poſſeſſe his ſoule and bodye in cleanneſſe and honour, in the honourable and vndefiled eſtate of marriage, who in his ſingle life was not able to doe it.</p>
            <p>And all this we teach moſt agreeably to the

For which cauſes worthilye ſaide a Biſhop of their owne, that there was greater reaſon to allow them againe to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:19102:89"/> then euer there was to forbid them. For which, and the like cauſes we alſo ſay, that ſuch vowes as binde men to liue in a wicked and vncleane life, not onely lawfully maye, but in duetie ought no leſſe to bee broken, then the wicked vowes of Herode, and of the <hi>40.</hi> men which had vowed the killing of Paule the Apoſtle. As for other vowes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are lawefully made, &amp; may be kept in the feare of god, we teach they ought inuiolably to be obſerued, denouncing to thoſe which ſhall not keepe them, that the Lorde will not hold him guiltleſſe that taketh his name in vaine.</p>
            <p>And this, touching vowes is the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of both our Churches. The commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of their doctrine ſaieth hee is iuſte and true dealing with men, who wil reaſon <hi>thus with them ſelues, that if a vowe to GOD be to be kept, then alſo a promyſe (whiche is a kinde of vowe that byndeth more then any obligation) to a man is to be obſerued.</hi> The benefit of not their, but of our doctrine, I graunt by an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the feare of God in keeping lawefull vowes, maye bee a meanes to woorke faythfull and iuſt dealinges amongſt men,

            <p>But this kinde of reaſoning (affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely from the greater to the leſſe) that if they will keepe promiſe to God, they will keepe alſo to men, is ſuch as cannot deſerue the logicke Lecture in either of their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minarie Colledges. And that a word, and as we commonly ſpeake, a bare word and promiſe ſhoulde binde more then a ſolemned inſtrument and obligation, as he writeth, is neither good diuinitie, nor humanitie.

For aunſwer to this I ſaye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> let the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of it be what it may be, we haue as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: beſides euery Wedenſday thorowe out the yeare, (wherin a certeine rate is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be obſerued of fiſhe) which wee haue more then they to counterpeaſe their obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunces and deuotions.</p>
            <p>But whereas he ſaieth they abſtain from fleſhe, to puniſh the bodye for more feruent ſeruing of God.</p>
            <p>This is a new deuice of this old learning, that when men will more ſeuerelye ſerue God at certeine tymes then other, they ſhould then abſtain from fleſh. For that pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſe, of faſting we read to haue bin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded at ſuch times, but of abſtinence from fleſh in no place. This neither our Sauiour Chriſt, nor his Apoſtles, nor anye other of the holy Prieſtes or Prophets before them, did comaund.</p>
            <p>The Nazarites in deede for the time of their vowe, abſtayned from wine and ſtrong drinke, by the expreſſe commaundement of God: But yet their profeſſion beeing to ſerue God more exactlye at ſuch tymes were not commanded to abſtain from fleſh: Neyther was this generally commanded at
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:19102:91"/> any time to al the Iewes, but a rule for ſuch particulars as ſhould take this vow of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rite vppon them, theſe contrariwiſe, when they will giue them ſelues the more to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe their bodyes, and to ſerue God, abſtain from fleſhe, and leaue free the vſe of wyne and of all fiſhe (wherof many are more dein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie then anye fleſhe for which cauſe the Grecians called their dayntieſt and fineſt feeding men eaters of fiſhe) and all other iunkettes of infinite varietie.</p>
            <p>And as they left them free, ſo they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate not for the moſt part to vſe their lyber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, no not their obſeruaunces: whereas a temperate and ſober dyet of Beefe and Mutton breade at home, would neuer haue coſte halfe ſo much as the forreine commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of wines and delicates of al ſorte, nor pamper the bodye, or make it ſo vnfitte for any good ſeruice. Which abſtinence how it puniſhed their bodyes appeared well in them: for their Abbotes and Monkes, and other ſuch like, were commonlye not the worſt fead, nor in worſt lyking.</p>
            <p>By which kinde of puniſhing the bodye, and abſtayning from fleſh, many times they grew ſo proude, as that they coulde not abſtaine from other fleſh, which God in deed had
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:19102:91"/> forbidden them. This was but a meere hypocriſie, vnder coulour of a ſtraite lyfe, to vſe a diet, that the Epicure and Philox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enus culd not haue wſhied a better, nor dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier for their own mouth. The exceſſe and daintineſſe of which diet being taken out of that hee reckoneth the ſauing of fleſh woulde come to: I ſuppoſe that whiche woulde remayne ouer and aboue that, woulde proue but a ſmall matter of benefit to a common Wealth. As for their obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of this and other pollitike and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall lawes, for conſcience ſake, is after in the eight article vpon more expreſſe and full occaſion to be anſwered.</p>
            <p>His vnreuerent ſpeeches of the Nobles and Iudges of the Lande, and of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall perſonnes is not anye theirs, but his owne iuſt reproche, to touch all degrees and States of the Lande, without anye cauſe. For in the myddenyght of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, and the verye deepeſt blindeneſſe, it was lawefull to haue a lycenſe vppon ſuch dayes to eate fleſhe: whiche beeing had, it was no offence. What reaſon then, why they that haue lycenſe, and take heede of offence, ſhoulde nowe bee thought for
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:19102:92"/> to tranſgreſſe? for to God in it ſelfe, and without contempte of the authoritie of the Magiſtrate it is no ſinne, as after is more fully to be declared. Concerning faſting, which is the <hi>4.</hi> article it is to bed vnderſtood, that the Church of God alwayes kept it by abſtaining from all manner of meate and drinke vnto the euening. which was in deed a faſt, when as theirs is onely the forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their Supper, when they haue well dined, or rather the eating at one glutton meale, the ſober diet of <hi>2.</hi> ordinary meales. By which account nothing is gayned to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> common Wealth: but ſinne and the puny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhment due vnto it. But if it were not ſo, yet for ſo little a gaine, nay, for no gaine the right order of true faſting, were to bee altered into a ſuperſtitious faſte of certeine dayes and tymes, which of neceſſitie, and vppon payne of euerlaſting death ſhoulde be obſerued. And of this there is vtterlye no neede in the common Wealth, GOD hauing ſo abundauntlye bleſſed the Lande with all ſtore of all victuall neceſſary for the vſe of our life.</p>
            <p>This were an neceſſarye pollycie in tyme of famyne, good counſell for a ſhipp
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:19102:92"/> that had ſpent her victualles, or a beſieged Citie, to wey euery man his meat, &amp; to ſhare him at his pittaunce, for one meale a daye. But to lay this vpon a free people, whom GOD hath bleſſed with a land of Ryuers of Mylke and Honny, to eate but one meale a daye, for almoſte halfe the yeare is no neceſſarye pollicye for this lande and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Naye, neyther neceſſarye nor fitte, but in cauſe of diſtreſſe, as I ſayde before, neyther for this nor for anye other. For with what reaſon or conſcience, ſhoulde the labouring man, that hath helde the plough by the end all the daye, or traueiled faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullye in anye other good calling, for the ſeruice of the Common Wealth, and to prouide for his owne neceſſities, and thoſe which depende vppon him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming weary and trauayled home at nyght, ſo great a parte of the yeare bee ſent fainte and feeble to his reſte, and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the bleſſing of GOD eate the fruit of his labour?</p>
            <p>Whye ſhoulde hee not ſtrengthen his hearte with a ſober relyefe, and gyue the due portion to his houſhold, to his wife, the moſte precious parte of his poſſeſſion,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:19102:93"/> &amp; as the vine of his houſe, &amp; his children ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>This ſauing is no huſbandry at al, where there is meate enough, to withdrawe from the people that, which in al lawe of God, of nature, and of nations is due vnto them, and neceſſary for the intertainment of their bodyes in health and ſtrength, to be able for the ſeruice of ſuch calling, as they are called to in the Common Wealth.</p>
            <p>This was neuer thought anye needefull pollycie in Iſrael, as populous as it ſhould ſeeme by the Stories, and more then Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, and hauing infinite more cauſe, without compariſon of ſpendinge the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion of the Lande by ſo manye Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and oblations, as they were bounde to offer, then we haue, which are bounde to none of thoſe things: whereof if an eſtimate were made, I think it wold fal out, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crifices &amp; offrings ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t more of their victual the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their <hi>160.</hi> dais of abſtinence ſaued al the yeare.

            <p>Wherefore the ſuperſtitious faſt, which this good huſbande, for a Common W. woulde perſwade, is vtterly needeleſſe in regarde of the great ſtore of the Land, thorowe the bleſſing of GOD, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawefull, as beeing contrarye to al law, and example of anye well pollycied ſtate and gouernement that euer was in the worlde, to take from him that laboureth, without anye cauſe ſo ordinarylye his neceſſarye foode.

And ſurely there are many iuſte cauſes to feare, leaſt the L. may commaunde this furnace to be heated yet ſeuen tymes more, and that the Angell of GOD which hath ſtoode ouer this Citie, with his drawen ſwoorde, to ſtrike it not onely

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the people thorowe the bleſſing of God vppon the woorde zealouſly preached vnto them, humbling their ſoules in true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as in ſackloth &amp; aſhes before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, and the Lords ſeruants in the midſt of them praying for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it is in <hi>Ioel: O Lord ſpare thy people &amp;c.</hi> It is to be hoped y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance &amp; prayers may ſtand, as <hi>Aaron</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his holy cenſors did in like caſe of plague in the gap and in the breach betweene the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and the dead, that the Angell of the Lorde ſtrike no more of vs downe with
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:19102:96"/> this fearefull hande and ſword wherewith wee haue ſeene alreadie ſo manie ſlaine and fall downe on euery ſide round aboute vs. A wiſe K. ſayth our Sauiour in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, ſeeing a mightier King then himſelfe comming againſt him with ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, as he is not able in any ſort to meete him in the filde, while hee is yet a farre off, ſendeth an ambaſſage vnto him for peace. Therefore ſeeing the Lorde of Hoſtes is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come out againſt vs with his armies, which we are in no ſort able to encounter, it were wiſedome for vs while it is yet time to ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d out an ambaſſage of praiers, of teares, and of true repentance, to make our peace and reconciliation with him, &amp; to reſtore vs to his gracious and accuſtomed fauour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Why ſhoulde we carry till the firſte begotten in euery houſe bee ſlaine, as it came to paſſe in the day of the vnrepentance of Egypt, or til the Angel of Zennacharib be ſent amongeſt vs, and that thouſands fall down beſides vs at our right hand and at our left? Thus I am bold as in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dutie of my calling to god &amp; to his church, But yet with al humilitie, an reuerence as ſpeaking to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, You are Gods, to ſtirre vp your godly wiſedomes
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:19102:97"/> to the remembrance of the duety which at this time the Lord God requireth of vs.</p>
            <p>Now I returne to my anſwere againe, wherein I haue alreadie ſhewed the R. faſt not only to want commandement, promiſe, or exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple in the word of God to approue it, but alſo to be ful of damnable and pharyſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call hypocriſie and pride: &amp; further briefly proued (referring the good Reader that is deſirous to be more fully inſtructed herein, to a godly and learned treatiſe written ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly of this matter in our own language) both commandement, promiſe, &amp; example, for the true and right order of faſt. Wherby it is euident, that the one prouoketh venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance againſt a ſuperſtitious people, and the other mercy &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bleſſing of God (wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dependeth the good eſtate of euery common wealth) to thoſe which are truely humbled. Therefore I will proceed now forward to the fift article of his compariſon.<note place="margin">The fift point of ſole life.</note> The fift is, that their doctrine commandeth ſole life to all cleargie men, and religious people as he ſpeketh, meaning prieſts cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterers, &amp; ſuch of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Laitie as were officers amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt them, wherof he noteth a double co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity. But firſt for their doctrine, I ſay it is expreſly contrary to the woorde of God,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:19102:97"/> which doth declare the gifte of continencie to be giuen but to a few, &amp; therfore not to ſo very great a number as he ſpeaketh of, &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth of Prieſtes, Monks, Friers, Nuns, &amp; other officers attendant vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I conclude this doctrine to be flat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the rule of the apoſtle, who ſaith for auoyding of fornication, let euery man haue his owne wife, and euery woman her owne huſband. And againe, If they do not contein let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> marry.</p>
            <p>Nowe let him tell mee what may come of diſobeying the commandement of God, deſpiſing his holy ordenance graciouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uided for remedie of incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie. Surely eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce hath declared w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was ſuch as it is maruel y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> L. hath not iudged that filthie and whoriſhe Churche, with the iudgement of an adultres many yeres ago. But he ſuppoſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all to haue liued chaſt contrary to the doctrine of our Sauiour Chriſt, as hath ben daclared, ſheweth a great commoditie of it, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the multitude of the people by ſuch meanes was greatly dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. But Sal. commended by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſte for a wiſe &amp; pollitike prince, ſaith, the honor of a king is in the multitude of his ſubiects: And common reaſon doeth ſufficientlye
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:19102:98"/> teache it, that the ſtrength and power of a prince is in the great number of his people: as the experience of al ages and ſtories of al times doth plainely teſtifie. Therfore being ſo very great a number as he ſaith, and as they were in deede, what high point of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie this may be I think few can vnderſtand. Now of the other part our doctrine is ſuch as we leaue it free to all men according as they ſhall finde them ſelues to bee called of God, and beſte able to ſerue him and his people in that place they ar appointed vnto, either to marry or to abſtaine. If any man haue that rare gift of continencie, while the Lorde continueth that fauour towards him he may vſe his bleſſing.</p>
            <p>Againe, they that finde themſelues to neede the help of marryiage that they may liue in holines and in honour as the Lorde hath commanded: wee teach according to the doctrine of the Apoſtle, that it is a diue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe doctrine to forbid them marriage, and affirme it to bee honorable amongſt al men, without any exception of degree, or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
            <p>And ſurely if this commandement, thou ſhalt not commit adultrie, be giuen vnto all men: If all bee to poſſeſſe by the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:19102:98"/> of God their veſſels in honour, then they which without marriage cannot liue chaſte and holy, not onely lawfully may but of neceſſarie duetie ought to marry. In whiche eſtate to feare the increaſe of the L. people, is to feare the bleſſing of the Lord. For as a bleſſing was it promiſed to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, that his ſeede ſhould bee as the ſande of the Sea in multitude, and as the Starres of heauen, which is oftentimes alſo noted as a greate fauour beſtowed vppon the people of Iſrael, both by Moſes and by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. Which being as it is a bleſſing to the land in any of the people, ſo is it eſpecially to the miniſters of the word,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.</note> if according to their duetie &amp; the exhortation of the Apoſtle, they bring vp their children in awe and feare of God, free from any iuſt charge of ryot &amp; intemperance, with all grace, comelineſſe and decent honeſtie, who otherwyſe are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie to haue charge of the Church and houſe of God.</p>
            <p>For then the common wealth ſhall bee happie not onely for that the people thereof are mnny, but that they are both many, and thoſe both wiſe and godly. And what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtrength can any ſtate or P. inioy then then ſuch a people.</p>
            <pb n="210" facs="tcp:19102:99"/>
            <p>As for his feare, that there ſhoulde want prouiſion for them all, if it were ſo, no god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe nor wiſedome, coulde caſt this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience vpon them rather then others. But this feare as it is voide of all reaſon, ſo is it full of infidelitie, and conuicted by the preſent experience. For thorow the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God, the abundance of all ſtore is heere ſo exceeding great, notwithſtanding both this increaſe of people nowe ſo many yeeres, againſt which he diſputeth, and a greate multitude of godly ſtrangers, that our neyghbours alſo taſte of the comfort of it. Whereas in the late time of their faſtes and ſole life, notwithſtanding al their pollicies of ſauing the prouiſion by their dayes of abſtinence and faſting, and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the marriage of ſo great a number of the people: yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> land was ſore viſited with famine. And this for anſwere to his firſt commoditie.</p>
            <p>The ſecond commodity he preſumeth to riſe to the common Wealth of the ſingle life of their cleargie, is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are able to keepe <hi>hoſpitalitie to ſpare the offalles of their liuings, as leaſes, copie holdes, and ſuche like, and to builde Colledges, Churches and other Monumentes of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:19102:99"/> pietie, the contrarye inconuenience he ſayeth the married life of our miniſters bringeth, who haue enough to do to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for themſelues and their children, as many times for all their care, they are ſo little able to do, as they leaue a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of poore orphanes behynd the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the charge of the pariſh.</hi> Touching the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I graunt it in part to be true, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſaith of their hoſpitality, offals, &amp; buyldings, but I deny their ſingle life to haue bin the only cauſe or any greate cauſe of it. For if they had contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with ſuch conuenient maintenance, as had beene fit for their calling, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their ſingle life they ſhould neuer haue bin able to haue kept y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houſes he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of, &amp; haue builded churches w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſſage of their liuings. But this it was y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rich, they woorſhipped him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed our ſauiour Chriſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to giue him al the K. &amp; glory of the worlde. They were neuer ſatiſfied like the graue, but heaped liuing vpon liuing, office vppon office, and that with the iniury and wrong of all the worlde. They impropriated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices and annexed them to their Abbeyes, monaſteries, &amp; other places, &amp; to their prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies &amp; dignities, a thing vtterly vnlawfull.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:19102:100"/> For how ſhould it be lawful when the poore pariſh (as he ſaith) giueth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tithe of al they haue to the end they may haue a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God amongeſt them, who may teache them the right way to ſerue and honour God, and to ſaue their ſoules, that this tithe ſhould be taken from them, and giuen to an idle cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Friers, or other that doe no duetie for it, and leaue the poore people ſpoyled of their goodes, and vnfurniſhed of one that ſhould be their guide to euerlaſting life. By which prophane couetouſneſſe they made them ſelues guiltie, not onely of their rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery of the goodes of the people which they enioyed without any iuſt title, but alſo of the deſtruction of their ſoules, in taking from them the meanes wherby they might be taught vnto ſaluation. And ſhall wee then eſteeme it a great liberalitie, that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the poore pariſhe had occaſion to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell by them that way to make him drinke or to giue him a meales meate? Euen as one that had robbed a man ſhoulde giue him a pennie when hee mette him in the high way: Theſe are the cuppes and diſhes, for whiche our Sauiour Chriſt thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth in the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>Yee Scribes, Phariſies, and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:19102:100"/> you make cleane the outſide of the cups and diſhes, but within they are full of robbery and wrong, for indeede thoſe theyr cuppes and diſhes ſo filled, were full of ſpoyle, nay of bloud, and that of the ſoules of menne whiche is one of the commodities they occupie, as it is in the Reuelation.<note place="margin">Apoc. 18.3.</note> with like impietie they annexed benefices vnto their Abbeyes and other houſes, and dignities by Popiſh diſpenſations, of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendamus</hi> non reſidences, Pluralities, tot quots, &amp; other more the like abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And not content herewith they had a thouſande other cunning ſhiftes howe to drawe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> riches of the people, yea the wealth of all the lande into their handes, as it well appeared at the putting of them downe in the late raigne of the renowmed K. Henry the eight. It was ſignified to the King, in a ſupplication, how thoſe iolly idle beggers as they are called there had robbed all the poore of the lande, al the hoſpitalles and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther almes houſes, and that they had drawn more then the third part of the whole lande into their poſſeſſion. With this manie times the common Wealth founde it ſelfe agreeued, and prouided diuers and ſundrie good lawes, as of mortmayne, mortua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:19102:101"/> and ſundry others againſt their coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, becauſe they gathered all to them as if they woulde haue dwelt alone in the lande, and yet exempted themſelues from the burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; charges of the Common W. Therefore, in this exceſſe, couetouſneſſe and inſatiable ſpoyle, if for pollicy to keepe the more quietly the poſſeſſion of ſo greate riches in their handes, they ſpared ſome meales and offalles to the poore people or buylded Colledges and Abbayes, they cannot bee eſteemed to haue increaſed the wealth and riches of the people, whom ſo diuerſly they ſpoyled and impoueriſhed. It had beene as it is nowe without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon more profitable for the common wealth: that euery man had enioyed his propriety in ſuche a portion, as the Lord by any good title ſhall bleſſe him with, by tylling and manuring whereof hee might haue beene able to maynteyne the eſtate GOD hath called him vnto, and not to ſtande wayting for offalles. But this was indeede a politike poynt for theyr owne gayne. For heereby they aſſured theyr eſtate by ſuch benefits and pleaſures, and bound men the more to depende vpon them, and to fauour their wicked ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:19102:101"/> for the gayne ſake.</p>
            <p>Nowe if married miniſters doe not the like, what hinderance is this to the common wealth: which hath in a great parte reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered agayne into her owne handes the landes and liuinges, whereby that Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality was kept, and theſe houſes buylded, whiche in all good reaſon muſt needes bee both more profitable and more honourable for the common wealth. For, that euery man ſitteth at home in his owne houſe, and eateth the fruite of his owne ground, and drinketh his owne water: is it not a thouſand tymes more profitable, and more to his iuſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation, yea, and more honourable then to ſeeke it els where, and to haue it at an other ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s doore? Further, if of that liuing they lawfully inioy, the miniſters prouide competently for their houſe &amp; childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Doth not the lawe of God, and of all nations al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe them ſo to doe? Yea, bynde them to it. For he that prouideth not for his houſe (ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Apoſtle) hath denyed the fayth, and is woorſe then an Infidell. As for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our miniſtery whereby hee obiecteth that many times they leaue a number of poore orphanes at the Pariſhes charges,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:19102:102"/> notwithſtanding in the miniſtery a number be ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly prouided. Yet is it indeed to be acknowledge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our miniſterie in many places is greatly vnprouided, contrary to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, &amp; to the iuſt cauſe of feare of his indignation againſt vs for it, if it bee not ſome way in tyme relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. But this eſpecially ariſeth of the ſpoile, which they made by impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating the liuing of ſo many particular chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to the maintenance of their cloiſters, &amp; neſts of their ſuperſtitious corruptions. for remedie wherof, we are moſt hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mble &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The contrary whereof as I haue ſaid, wee haue from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who by impropriating the liuings of the Miniſters from the places where vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they appertein, haue left the miniſtery ſo marueylouſly vnprouided, as that in ſome places there are to be found many pariſhes together, whereof all the liuings y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for ſuch vſe, are not ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> compitent maintenance of one man &amp; his family. which lamentable eſtate of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery muſt needs be an infinite hinderance to the Goſpel, both in the iuſtice of GOD who will puniſhe ſo great a contempt of his worde, and ſo careleſſe a negligence of the ſaluation of the people, and alſo in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing it ſelfe: For by this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. ſuch as are in ſome acceptable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure able to doe good ſeruice in the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, withdrawe themſelues from it.

It hath a promyſe to breake the Bread vnto the hungrye, and to make the thryſty drinke, and not to turne away the eare from him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cryeth for reliefe in his neceſſity.

            <p>And as our Churche heretofore by other meanes hath cryed oftentimes, euen till ſhee haue almoſt loſt her voyce: ſo now agayne ſhe cryeth by this moſt humble ſupplication to your Honours, to regarde her neceſſitie. if wealth, peace, wiſdome, authoritie, or any other thing be needeful for this worke, the Lorde hath bountifully furniſhed the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with al that needeth. Some reaſonable way without the iniurie of any might by your wiſdomes be found, whereby euery pariſhe might recouer againe their own, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce of a worthy miniſterie amongſte them. Alas that for anye cauſe ſo manye ſoules of the people committed to your charge, ſhould periſhe. Wherfore, my good Lords, turne your eares, I beſeech you, to heare the humble ſuite of this Church, that the Lord your redeemer may turn his eares vnto you in the day when you ſhall call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him. So ſhall the ſaued ſoules of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandes prayſe God for you, ſo ſhall the Lord bleſſe you, and your noble poſteritie: and ſo both all this and ſuche other ſlaunderous mouthes ſhall be ſtopped, which are now ſo wide open againſt vs. To the aunſwering

For as for takyng, thei not onely tooke whatſoeuer Princes offered, but extorted of them and their ſubiectes withall importunacie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie. And for bryngyng into bondage, thei eſtemed all kynges to be but their vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalles, and the Pope to be Kyng of Kynges and Lorde of lordes, as muche greater then the Emperour, as the Sonne exceedeth the Moone. Therfore the Pope hath vſed them thereafter as Pages and footmen, to waite and attende vppon hym, for meaneſt ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces while he rode in his Pontificalibus.</p>
            <p>He hath made theim kiſſe his feete and an Emperour to ſtande three daies bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foote at his gates before he could be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and then trode vpon his necke when he humbled hymſelf vnto hym, abuſing that Scripture to his pride: thou ſhalt tread vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Baſiliſcke, and ſtampe the Dragon vnder thy feete. He hath plaied at Tennis with their Crounes, toſſing them from one to an other as it pleaſed hym: accordyng as

And in like maner with the ſacred imperiall Croune, taking it from the Grecians and giuyng it to the Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards, then taking it from them and giuing it to the Frenche, and from them againe to the Germaines, and from one houſe of the Lordes of Germany to an other. He hath vſed them in all reſpectes as pleaſed hym, and as if thei had helde their Crounes of his kayes: he hath made them fight his warres at their owne coſt and charges.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, hauyng thus abuſed the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and ſupreme authoritie of ſoueraigne Magiſtrates: how ſhould this Sollicitor of the Pope perſwade that their Religion is profitable for Princes: or how can he think to make them beleeue, the Goſpel to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie vnto them, whereby thei are Princes in deede ſubiect to no forreine power within their owne Dominion, but the immediate Liutenaunts of almightie God. Which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng in deede ſet their Crounes with great honour vpon their head, aſſured their Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in their handes, and eſtabliſhed their royall Seates vnderneath them: It can not be but godly Magiſtrates muſt needes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thankfully to GOD and to his

But lett vs heare what cunnnyng charme he hath prepared for this purpoſe. We teache ſaieth he that al Lawes of Magiſtrates whiche are of thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges good or indifferent, yea, or not expreſly contrary to Gods commaundement, are to bee obeyed with that conſcience that a man, that willyngly breaketh theim openly or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretely, ſhould think he ſinneth againſt God becauſe he is Gods Miniſter. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their doctrine, but I require their grounde. But he will ſaie: whether the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine bee true or falſe, yet is it profitable for Princes and States. I aunſwere hym as before, that it is an infallible rule, and to bee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantly and inuiolably obſerued by all that are not <hi>Atheistes,</hi> that there is no doctrine profitable to a Common wealth that is not godly and ſound, what ſhewe of profite ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it may ſéeme to haue for a ſeaſon. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, bothe in this and in the reſt, if he would
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:19102:108"/> haue perſwaded their doctrine to bee for a Common wealth, he ſhould firſt haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it true, otherwiſe he might offer vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the wicked doctrine of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet. If he haue no other rule but this, it is for the obedience of Kynges and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whether the doctrine be true or falſe: I ſaie that there is no obedience good nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for Magiſtrates to bee giuen vnto them. (If wee will iudge of goodneſſe and profite by the worde of God, as wee ought to doe) but onely that whiche God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poincted that ſubiectes ſhould giue to their Princes. Therefore, before it can be iudged whither of our doctrines be more profitable, we muſt bebate the matter whither of them is better warranted by the woorde of God.</p>
            <p>Our doctrine concernyng the duetie and obedience of ſubiectes vnto their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Magiſtrates, as it appeareth by the Harmonie of our confeſſions is this. That ſubiectes are bounde, to be ſubiect vnto all lawfull Magiſtrates, hye or lowe, good or euill, and that not onely for angre, that is for feare of the puniſhement, whiche the Magiſtrate maie puniſhe the Rebellious with, but alſo for conſcience ſake. Whiche woordes of the Apoſtle, for conſcience ſake
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:19102:108"/> we thus vnderſtande. Magiſtrates are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of God, appoincted and ordeined by hym, for defence and praiſe of the good, and for iuſte puniſhement and execution of the wicked: Therefore, he that ſhall reſiſte the Magiſtrate, ſhalbee giltie in conſcience of makyng reſiſtance againſte God. Further alſo, God in his moſte holy Lawe of the ten Commaundementes, vnder the precept of honoryng our Parentes, doeth commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de vs as to do to other all ſuche duties, whiche for any perticuler reſpect we owe vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as the Apoſtle expoundeth it in the ſame place) ſo chiefly to yeeld vnto Magiſtrates all dueties belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gyng vnto them: emongeſt whiche, ſubiection and obedience is the principall. By whiche commaundment (as by all the preceptes of the Morall Lawe of God) our conſcience ſtandeth bound before hym, to giue to Magiſtrates, (whiche are the Miniſters of his Iuſtice in puniſhmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, or rewarders properly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernyng this life) ſuche duetie as by the right of their place, miniſterie and ſeruice, vnder hym, doeth appertaine vnto theim: Of whiche ſorte are ſubiection, obedience, loue, honor, paimentes, ſeruice, praiers, and ſuche like declared by the worde of God, to belong to
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:19102:109"/> their hye and honourable callyng. And all ſuche we affirme, Subiectes ought not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their willes and for feare, but harte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and chearfully to giue vnto them for con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcience ſake, as knowyng theim to bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poincted of GOD, and for conſcience of Gods Commaundement, whiche bindeth vs vnto it. For, God becauſe he is our crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour and reedemer, bothe of our ſoules and bodies, hath iuſte aucthoritie to giue lawes whiche ſhould binde them bothe, and as he hath right to commaund our ſoules and bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dies, ſo is he able to puniſhe bothe for the breache and tranſgreſſion of his lawe.</p>
            <p>Therefore, worthely Saincte Iames ſaieth, that there is one Lawgiuer, who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaue and deſtroye that is euerlaſtyngly and that but one onely. For this conſcience of the Commaundement of God all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes and Apoſtles, yea, our Sauior hym ſelf was ſubiecte vnto Magiſtrates, and ſo taught al men to giue to Ceſar that which is his. By whoſe doctrine and example we muſt willyngly, euen for conſcience of the ordinaunce and commaundement of God, of what callyng ſoeuer we be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> profeſſe the Goſpell, ſubmit our ſelues in all humilitie and reuerence vnto them and their lawes,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:19102:109"/> whatſoeuer not repugnaunte to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes of almightie GOD. We ſeke not by any maner of prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt our ſelues from their Courtes and auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, nor from bearing the burden and char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges, whiche thei lawfully laye vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all their Subiectes, for the neceſſarie ſeruice of the Commonwealthe. We hold Princes not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandyng any cenſure of the Churche, to remaine our lawfull Princes ſtill, in the poſſeſſion and right of their Croune, ſtate, and dignities, as before: and the ſubiectes bounde in conſcience of the ordenance and commaundement of God, to obeie them as their lawfull Princes, yea, though thei bee Heathen men, and to performe al the good dueties of Subiectes vnto them, bothe in their goodes and bodies. And this by the grace of GOD is bothe our doctrine and practiſe, well and ſoundly grounded vpon the holie worde of God: contrary to which no churche profeſſing the Goſpell, no good writer, neither <hi>Caluine</hi> whom he noteth, nor any other haue taught, or mainteined any doctrine. Now let vs compare the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and practiſe of the pretended Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, with ours. Their Cleargie howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer (as this man goeth about) thei would
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:19102:110"/> binde heauie burdens (like the Phariſies,) vpon other mennes ſhoulders, yet would thei not touche theim with one of their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Thei would in deede haue other men beleue, thei ought to haue a conſcience, not onely of the Lawe of God, but of humaine Lawes, whiche muſte holde onely till the Pope doe diſcharge theim: for then thei teache, thei maie depoſe euen the higheſt from their places and that by force of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes. But their Cleargie that binde other men thus, exempte theim ſelues from the Courtes of ciuill Magiſtrates, from paie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes and other ſeruices due vnto them: and giue all ſuche dueties to a forrain Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Court, and to the Popes cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Thei content not theim ſelues with ſuche Priuiledges as their lawfull Prince and Countrie, ſhall ſee cauſe to beſtowe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon theim, but challenge of right and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie freedome from all Ciuill burdens, by vertue of their Cleargie. Thei compound with the Popes Chamber, for ſuche thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as thei paie, and in all reſpectes carrie theim ſelues as ſubiectes to the Pope, and to none other. And thus thei vſe the Ciuill Magiſtrate, euen whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei deale beſt with them, and whiles thei are miniſters of their
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:19102:110"/> ſuperſtition and crueltie. But if thei once diſpleaſe theim a little, and that the Pope begin to Thunder and Excommunicate, then thei depoſe kynges, and Emperours from their Regall ſeates, and Imperiall thrones, thei holde theim no more for law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Princes, thei abſolue and ſette free all their Subiectes from their othe and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience due vnto them: thei Excomunicate and curſe all ſuche as ſhall obeye any their lawes, or by any acte yeelde the duetie of a ſubiect vnto them. Finally, thei co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde the ſubiectes to take Armes againſt ſuche their Princes, and by force and violence to take their Crounes from their heddes, and ſette them vpon ſome other. And thus as other heretofore haue dealte with the twoo Henries and Frederickes Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, with Philip le Bell and other the Frenche kynges, and with ſondrie kinges of this noble lande: So alſo he that of late did ſitt, and he that now ſitteth in the chaire of Peſtilence, haue dealte with our Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Ladie and Queene Elizabeth.</p>
            <p>This then being their doctrine and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, and ours ſo contrarie to it: whereby ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the right due vnto Princes from God, wee honour and obeye them: and thei
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:19102:111"/> to the hye offence of God and men diſhonor and depoſe euen at their pleaſure? How can any man touche vs in any reſpecte as wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng duetie in this behalfe, or excuſe theſe Catholique Traitors and Heritickes from beeyng giltie of hye Treaſon againſt the Croune and dignitie of all lawful Princes, as thei are alſo againſt the honour of God and his ſonne Chriſt Ieſus. But this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor chargeth vs that <hi>Caluin</hi> ſaieth: <hi>No law of man can binde the conſcience.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (ſaith he) <hi>it muſt needes followe that the obedience wee yeeld, is onely for pollicie and feare.</hi> For aunſwere whereunto I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the conſequent, and affirme the firſt, not to proue or inferre the ſecond. For the firſt, if bothe <hi>Caluin</hi> and we ſaie that there is but one Lawgiuer: Saint Iames hath taught it before vs, and giueth an euident reaſon of it: whiche is, that there is but one who (euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtyngly) is able to ſaue and to deſtroye. For his law onely can binde the ſoule, who hath authoritie to puniſhe the ſoule for brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng of his lawe. But God onely is able to doe this, as Sainct Iames here teacheth, and our Sauiour Chriſte in the Goſpell: Therfore the ſoule and conſcience can haue no other Lawgiuer but God alone. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:19102:111"/> his lawes onely can binde the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, who can not erre in makyng Lawes, which being the peculier honor of God, his Lawes onely can binde vs in that reſpect. Whiche if it were otherwiſe, we ſhould be as deepely bounde to keepe, ſtudie, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and teach the Canons of the church, the Statutes and Lawes of the lande, as we are the Lawe of God. Whiche if thei did in deede beleeue, it is a maruell how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer theſe men that breake ſo ordinarily the the lawes of God and of man, bothe of the Churche and commonwealth, ſhould hope to be ſaued by their workes, and dreame of workes of ſuperogation, for the relief of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But though wee acknowledge no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bond of conſcience, to obſerue any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Lawes whatſoeuer, then the Lawe of the ten Commaundementes doeth laye vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs: yet doeth it not hereof followe, that our conſcience is free from keepyng any Lawe of man. For wee are bounde by the Lawe of God to yeeld vnto all men, ſuche duetie as belongeth to theim, and namely to ſuche as are in aucthoritie, either in the Commonwealth, or in the Churche, honor, loue, dutie, obedience, ſubiection, and ſuche like. Therfore, though the lawe of man do
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:19102:112"/> not binde our conſcience to bee ſubiecte to princes &amp; their lawes: yet doe we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the lawe of God doeth binde vs to all obedience, whiche he hath commaunded to be giuen vnto theim. For further clearyng of this matter, it is to bee vnderſtoode, that all lawes are either ſimply good or euill, or thei are ſuche in reſpect. The lawes which are ſimply good, are onely the tenne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes of the morall lawe of God, whiche binde the ſoule and conſcience ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to obedience, and ſo ſtraitly without al exception, that no circumſtance or occaſion maie make that lawfull, whiche is there forbidden, or vnlawfull whiche is there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded. Now, humaine lawes and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces of men, whiche commaunde or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidde the ſame, whiche are commaunded or forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the lawe of God: As thou ſhalt not murther, commit whoredome, ſteale, or ſuche like are alſo ſimply good, and binde the conſcience: yet not in any regard of the commaundement of men, for ſuche reaſon as is before alledged, but onely becauſe thei are the ſame, whiche were before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by the liuyng God. Of the other parte, ſuche are ſimply euill Lawes, as in commaundyng or forbiddyng, are oppoſite
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:19102:112"/> and contrarie to the Lawe of the ten com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes. And theſe, as touching the keepyng of theim, it is ſo farre of that thei ſhould binde vs, that contrariwiſe we ſtand bounde by the lawe of God, to doe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. There remaineth the ſeconde kinde of humaine Lawes, whiche are not good ſimply alwaies, and to all men, but in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralitie for a time, and ſome good reſpect: beyonde whiche boundes, the weakeneſſe of man can not reache. For that whiche is now good for the Commonwealthe, maie fall out at an other tyme, and in an other reſpecte (whiche peraduenture was not thought of) to be hurtful, not onely to ſome perticuler man, but euen to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealthe it ſelf. Further, though thei be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo good for the tyme, and neuer ſo wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, yet euen for that tyme that thei appeare to bee beſte, are thei not of the ſame ſorte with the Lawes of GOD and ſuche as are ſimplie good in theim ſelues that thei ſhould binde the conſcience. For though menne haue ſought to make ſuche Lawes, moſte agreeable to the generall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of the woorde of GOD, yet haue thei no aſſuraunce to haue attained vnto it, neither in deede can haue any warraunte,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:19102:113"/> that thei haue erred in no circumſtaunce belongyng therevnto, becauſe of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of man, bothe in iudgement and in affection: but that whiche maie binde the conſcience, is ſuche as proceadeth from an other, that cannot erre in commaundyng.</p>
            <p>I adde further herevnto, that the Ciuill and Ceremoniall Lawe of the Iewes, though thei were bothe expreſſely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of GOD, who could not faile in any poincte, yet did thei not ſimplie binde the conſcience. For in caſe of antinomie and repugnaunce with the Morall Lawe, (as our Sauiour argueth by the example of Dauid, in eatyng of the preſence bread, whiche otherwiſe it had not been lawfull for hym to haue eaten, but in caſe of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie for ſauing his life, commaunded in the Morall Lawe) a man was not guiltie of hauyng ſinned, by ſuche breakyng of the policie of the Churche. And if theſe lawes notwithſtandyng GOD were aucthour of theim who could not erre, yet did not ſimplie binde the conſcience: muche leſſe can thoſe whiche are of men, either in the Churche or Commonwealthe. Whereby it appeareth, wee are bounde to the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng of thoſe kinde of Lawes, that is, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beye
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:19102:113"/> theim with a Ciuill obedience, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſcience of ſynne for any breache of theim, whiche is proper to the Lawe of GOD, excepte wee breake theim in ſuche ſorte as wee make our ſelues thereby alſo guiltie of tranſgreſſyng the Lawe of God, doyng it with hatred reſiſtaunce, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, or other offence againſt aucthoritie, whiche GOD hym ſelf hath forbidden. Which plainlie ſheweth our Aduerſaries argument, that is, <hi>Excepte wee beleeue the Lawes of men to binde our conſcience, wee haue nothyng to hinder vs from rebellion,</hi> to bee rather a ſlaunderous ſurmiſe of his owne, then any good conſequent of reaſon. For by the grace of GOD wee are ſtaied from ſuche wicked and vnlawfull attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes (whiche are proper to our pretenſed Catholikes, whoſe mouthes are full of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and who vtter woordes as it is in the Pſalme, ſoft as Butter, and ſmothe as Oile, but their hartes are ſharpe as twoo edged ſwordes, and their deedes moſte full of Rebellion and diſobedience) by conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Commaundement of GOD, who hath expreſſely forbidden theim. But their perpetuall Rebellious practiſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Princes, dooe plainly ſhewe that
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:19102:114"/> this doctrine was deuiſed.</p>
            <p>But all ſtories make mention, that thei haue allowed them ſelues any thing to the diſhonor of pinces, kynges and Emperors haue been abuſed by them, as their vaſſalls and ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, and that to as baſe ſeruices, as to leade the Popes horſe, and to hold his Stirruppe: thei haue not vouchſaufed for a long tyme to admitte theim to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but kepte them at their gates. Thei haue troden in their neckes, and taken of and put on their Crounes with their foote. Further, thei haue taken vpon theim to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe theim from their Regall ſeates and Imperiall Thrones, and place in theim, whom it liked them. The ſoonne hath been ſtirred vp by theim againſt his Father, and the ſubiect and ſeruaunt againſt his Lorde and maiſter, to take the Empire from him. Thei haue made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after a ſorte, to ſue out their Liuerie, as if thei had been his War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and forced them to paie full dearely for it, ere thei could obtaine it.</p>
            <p>Finallie, thei haue freed the Subiecte, from their othe and obedience to their law<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full Prince, and filled their Countries with inſurrection and rebellions againſte them. I neede not to vouche many authors
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:19102:114"/> for their ſo notorious actes, whiche cannot bee forgotten, whiles the famous memorie of the Henries and Frederickes Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and alſo ſundrie Kynges, bothe in Fraunce, and in this noble lande ſo diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and iniuried by theim, ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue. But if all monumentes of tymes paſt were forgotten, this preſent age doeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe ſo many examples of their vnfaithful diſobedience to Princes both in other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and here at home: as I can want no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence againſte hym in this matter. For their continual practiſes of rebellion, their procuryng of Bulles from Roome againſt her Maieſtie: their writyng of Libells and infamous bookes, to the diſhonour of her highneſſe renowned Father, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuche dealynges of theirs, maie ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently beare witneſſe hereof. Therefore, it is to late now for them to plaie the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, and pretende to aduaunce the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ſtate of Princes: whereas their Religion hath ſo intreated other Princes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, as hath beene declared: and ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended their owne naturall Prince at home as her Maieſtie hath beene conſtrained to make ſtraight lawes for her moſte neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie and iuſt defence againſt them. They
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:19102:115"/> ſhould now cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ningly perſwade they ſought to aduaunce the ciuill authoritie of Princes, whereas Kinges and Emperours haue had almoſt continuall warres with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to keepe thetr own. For through their ambition, thei neuer contented themſelues with their own place, but would affect bothe the ſwordes, ſeekyng and bearyng the honourable char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the ciuill eſtate, &amp; their Conſiſtories vſurpyng the lawfull iuriſdiction of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo as the Kynges of this lande haue been conſtrained to prouide for their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie by lawes of Premunire, and ſuche like to bridle their intollerable and ambicious v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation. Therefore, of all other he might beſt haue left out this Article. For it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, thei were neuer longer freendes to Princes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei might abuſe them as their vaſſalles, to bee the Miniſters of their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe. And ſo muche for aunſwere to this point.</p>

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:19102:115"/> to regard that the life of his ſubiectes bee ciuill and honeſt, but alſo that it be religious and godly. Therfore we are taught to praie for theim, that wee maie liue vnder theim a peaceable life, not onely in all honeſtie, but alſo in all godlineſſe, or true worſhippe of GOD, as the woorde vſed by the Apoſtle doeth ſignifie. And to the Roma. the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate is declared to be the Miniſter of God, for the praiſe and puniſhement of thoſe that doe well and ill, without reſtraint. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Apoſtle ſheweth it to be the duetie of the Magiſtrate, to protecte and incourage, not onely quiet and ciuill men, but alſo and that chiefly, thoſe, whiche moſt endeuour to liue in the feare of God, in his true worſhipp and obedience. Whiche duetie what Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ſoeuer ſhall not performe, but moſte diſlike with, and diſcourage the godlie, whiche ſhine as lights afore a wicked gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſtandeth giltie and aunſwerable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, for the abuſe of the aucthoritie he hath receiued of GOD, eſpecially for this purpoſe, to bee a comfort to ſuche as moſte zealouſly and ſincerely, ſeeke to ſerue him. On the other part for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> puniſhment of euil, the Magiſtrate is bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to puniſh tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, accordyng to the qualitie of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,

Therefore the king was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to take a copie of the whole lawe, and not of the ſecond Table onely, that he ſhould looke to the execution as well of the firſte Table, yea, and that in the firſte place, as to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde. Which we ſee in the holie Storie to haue beene executed by the zealous &amp; noble Kynges of <hi>Iſraell</hi> and <hi>Iuda,</hi> commaunding by their authoritie, the purgyng of the lande of Idolatrie, the ſettyng vp and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng Gods true Religion and ſeruice, and the iuſt execution of the Prieſtes of <hi>Baall.</hi> And of <hi>Aſa</hi> it is written, that he made a lawe after he had reſtored the ſtate of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that whoſoeuer ſhould not ſeeke the Lorde God of their fathers: that is, worſhip him in ſuche order as by the lawe of Moiſes was commaunded, that he ſhould dye for it.</p>
            <p>Thus muche I haue thought neceſſarie
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:19102:116"/> by the waie, to ſet doune touching this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, vpon occaſion of the Magiſtrates office vnder God reſtrained by this author, to the procuryng of a Ciuill life onely emongeſt their Subiectes, referryng all abuſes of the Churche, and of the ſeruice of God to their ſupreme Paſtour, as thei call hym. Now let vs ſee the diuerſe doctrine of theim, and vs, touchyng bothe theſe poinctes. Of ſinne he ſaieth, thei teache ſome are mortall and ſome veniall: and we teach y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al are mortall. I graunt this to be their and our doctrine, but the expoſition of it, and the concluſion he inferreth would bee well obſerued. If by mortall and veniall ſinnes, thei vnderſtood onely that there is greate difference of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and that ſome are more greeuous, and therefore with greater ſeueritie to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed then others, ſome againe are leſſe, and not to bee puniſhed with like horrible tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes as the other, we were well agreed. For this appeareth to bee our doctrine, by the confeſſion of our Churches, and all our good writers, and that agreably to the holy ſcriptures. For ſo our ſauiour teacheth vs, that the firſte Table whiche is of dueties, immediatly reſpectyng God, is the greateſt and cheefeſt commaundement, and that the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:19102:117"/> ignoraunt ſeruaunt, is to be beaten but with fewe ſtripes, but he that knoweth, and yet doeth not his maiſters will, is to be beaten with many ſtripes. Likewiſe of ſuche peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Cities as ſhall contemne and refuſe the holie doctrine of the Goſpell, our ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaieth, it ſhall bee eaſier in that daie for Tyre and Sidon, for Sodom and Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rha, then for that Citie. Whereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that there is a greate difference of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Which we ſo acknowledge, as that we graunt euery pretept to bee greater then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, accordyng to the place it hath in the twoo Tables, and conſequently the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of it to bee greater, then the breach of any that follow it. Yet if the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon be made of ſinnes in like degree and proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> offendyng againſt both, as of thought with thought, acte with acte, and theſe in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers kindes, as the greateſt tranſgreſſion of the one, with the greateſt breache of the other, and ſo likewiſe in the reſte, keepyng a due rate and equalitie of ſinnes, that are matched together. Therefore notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng, wee eſteeme not ſinne light, but all in their natures mortall and deadly, yet wee make a great difference of ſinnes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if thei vnderſtoode by this diſtinction,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:19102:117"/> no other matter, but to make a difference that ſome ſhould bee greater then others, thei haue no cauſe to ſtriue with vs. And for this, what commoditie it maie bryng to a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale, we are in the bleſſing of God to looke for it, this beyng our doctrine. But thei vnderſtande it farre otherwiſe, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the Counſell of Trent, and by this aucthour. For, bothe determine mortal to be ſuche, as by their natures and in iuſtice deſerue euerlaſtyng death, wherein we alſo agree. But the poinct of variaunce is in this that thei ſaie, all ſinnes are not mortall, but that there are ſinnes, whiche in iuſtice are not to bee puniſhed with euerlaſtyng death, whiche kinde of ſinne thei call veniall. Not vnderſtandyng that God for Chriſtes ſake, doeth forgiue it thoſe whiche beleeue, for ſo wee graunt that al are veniall. For to the beleeuer all ſhall be forgiuen, and there ſhall be no imputation of any ſinne: but takyng it in this ſenſe which I haue declared, in which I deny any ſinne to be veniall, &amp; affirme all to be mortall: whiche our doctrine is grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the worde of God. For, this is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of all ſinne, whiche the Apoſtle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception of any ſaieth, that the paine of ſinne is death, meanyng euerlaſtyng, as it
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:19102:118"/> appeareth there by the mention of life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtyng life in the ſame place. And thus the Apoſtle taught according to the lawe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is ſaied expreſſely, curſed bee he that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth not in all that is commaunded in this Lawe. But ſaieth he, though your doctrine bee true, yet doeth it not ſtande with good pollcie, whiche is to kepe men in vertue and honeſtie, as ours doth: <hi>Becauſe if al be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, who will ſtriue againſt ſinne: whereas admittyng all not to bee mortall, though a man be caried into a veniall ſinne, yet would he ſtriue to refraine from mortall, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng it bringeth damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> And though this Romane doctrine be falſe, yet doeth it more incourage men to ſtriue againſt ſinne. But I ſaie, this is to reaſon like an Atheiſte. For as I haue often ſaied before, there can be no doctrine fit to procure the bleſſing of God to any ſtate, (whervpon dependeth the wealth peace, and honour of euery people and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth) but only that which is of God. And therfore whatſoeuer he maie ſuppoſe in our or their doctrine, to bee for or againſt a ſtate, the truthe muſte needes bee, that all thynges reckened, and in the ende, it can neuer proue a good doctrine for any ſtate that God hath not taught, nor that vnproffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:19102:118"/> whiche he hath deliuered vs. But I ſaie further, that our doctrine in the Nature of the doctrine it ſelf, is more to reſtrainyng fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vice, then that of theirs. For, what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter incouragement can there bee in all good reaſon and pollicie to ſinne then impietie, &amp; what ſtronger reſtraint then greeuous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhement. Therfore, their doctrine whiche teacheth ſo many ſinnes, negligences, and ignoraunces, not to bee in the iuſtice of the Lawe of God guiltie of death, muſt needes hereby giue incouragement to continue in ignoraunce, in negligences, and other ſuche like offences. But ours whiche truely tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the wrathe of God, and euerlaſtyng death to depende vpon it, muſte needes bee more forceble to ſtirre vp all men, to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to auoide to the vttermoſte of the grace thei haue receiued, all maner of ſinne, and if the leſſe, muche more the greater, whiche haue more greeuous condemnation. But he and the reſt of theſe Romaniſts, in faith &amp; in allegiaunce, ſuppoſe by makyng all ſinnes, to be puniſhed with death, that all are taught to be equall, whiche is nothyng ſo. For that death is not like vnto this, whiche is of the naturall ſoule and bodie, and of the life of the naturall man: but it is a deadly caſtyng
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:19102:119"/> out of the preſence and fauour of God, with whom onely is life (that which in deede and truth maie be ſo called for the comforte that is in it) whereas the other is ſuche a life, as ſome which liue in it, wiſhe rather for death and would digge for it: As Iob ſpeaketh, if thei might finde it, and deſire that the Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines might couer them, and the Hilles hide them from the wrath of God liyng vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them. Therfore if it be poſſible for men in the naturall death of the bodie, to deuiſe greate difference of tormentes, ſo as not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandyng all ſuffer death, yet one maie endure (without compariſon) greater tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes in it then an other: How much more in this caſe both by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> natur of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death which thei ſuffer, and by the almightie power of God, is it poſſible that notwithſtandyng all ſinnes bee puniſhed with death, yet there ſhould be ſundrie kindes of that death, &amp; the tormentes of the one to bee in compariſon (in them ſelues alwaies horrible) more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and tollerable then an other. Which our Sauiour Chriſt expreſſely teacheth, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the puniſhment of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and ſuche as ſhould with contempt refuſe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell. Wherefore, that beyng an offence of their ignoraunce, &amp; not of our doctrine it is
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:19102:119"/> not to bee imputed vnto it. And ſo notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandyng any thyng is ſaied by hym, or can bee ſaied by any to the contrary, our doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine in this point is moſt fit and ſtrong for the reſtraint of ſinne, and their impunitie moſte daungerous by incouragement to ſmaller offences, to draw men alſo in tyme to the eaſier committyng of the greater. Beſides in this their doctrine it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that thei teache the ſprincklyng with a little Holly water to be ſufficient to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie thoſe ſinnes: whereby the precious death of our Sauiour Chriſt is in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe made of none effect. For if thei bee not mortall ſinnes, the puniſhment whereof in the iuſtice of God is death: then Chriſt dyed not for them: and if he did, then it followeth bothe that thei are mortall, and death the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde and ſtipende of them, and alſo that the guilt of them can not bee otherwiſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed out, but with the true Yſſope ſprinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng vs with the moſt precious bloud of the ſonne of God, whiche purgeth all our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. The ſecond poinct in this nineth Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, is of the doctrine of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiſcence which he ſaieth that we affirme to be truely ſinne, euen in the regenerate: and thei ſaie in the regenerate, that is, as this man affirmeth
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:19102:120"/> it in Chriſtians after Baptiſme (as if al that are waſhed with the water of Baptiſme, are alſo borne againe, whiche is no more true, then that all receiuyng the Lordes Supper, ſhould receiue alſo the Spirite of Chriſt, which the Apoſtle denyeth) to be no ſinne, except that concupiſcence bee conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto. I acknowledge this to be our doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, whiche to bee agreeable to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures it appeareth by this, that whatſoeuer the lawe forbiddeth is ſinne, for of the lawe is the knowledge of ſinne, but this concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence is forbidden by the lawe. This the Aduerſarie will not graunt, but I proue it thus. There are but two co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiſcences for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, one with conſent, and an other with out, whereof that whiche is with conſent is forbidden in the former commaundements. Which appeareth by the expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth Commaundement by our Sauiour Chriſt in the ſixth of Matthewe, who ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth the luſtyng after a Woman in harte: that is with conſent, to be Adultery and the breache of the ſeuenth Commaundement. Therefore it followeth, the other is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the laſt. And in deede if the ſame concupiſcence were forbidden in the former, and no other in this, then ſhould
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:19102:120"/> there not bee tenne Preceptes and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes but onely nine. This alſo the Apoſtle teacheth, who declareth how harde it was for hym to finde the height and depth, the length and breadth of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption that is in the nature of man, till he rightly vnderſtood this Commaundement. For thereby he plainely ſheweth the moſte ſecrete poyſon of our nature to bee diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by this. Which can be no other then the very continuall ſpringyng and wellyng vp of vnlawfull luſtes, euen before the harte reſolutely agree vnto them. Otherwiſe ther might bee in vs a motion and a power not ſtandyng with the loue of GOD nor of our Neighbour without offence to GOD. Whiche can not bee, the Lawe requiryng of vs that perfect holineſſe of nature where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we were created. And ſurely if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had not eſteemed this rebellion in his nature to bee ſinne and mortall ſinne, he would neuer haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plained ſo greeuouſly of his eſtate in reſpect of it, both in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as he doth, and eſpecially in the ſeuenth Chapter of the Epiſtle to the Romaines in a greate parte of it, and in the ende criyng: Miſerable man that I am who ſhall deliuer me from this bodie of death.</p>
            <pb n="254" facs="tcp:19102:121"/>
            <p>Their doctrine beyng contrarie, hath no maner of grounde in the Scripture. For as for the firſt of Iames, it is plaine he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of ſuche a ſinne as ſheweth it ſelf in an open and outward act to be ſinne. As for S. <hi>Austine,</hi> though his authoritie, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fathers maie be ſufficient to warrant any doctrine to be of God: yet takyng hym, alleadged not for any ſuche purpoſe, but as a witneſſe of the doctrine taught and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the Churche at his tyme: I graunt he ſo writeth of concupiſcence, as except his writynges be well examined and conferred together, a man would thinke he were of the opinion of our Aduerſarie. But beyng examined, it will be found that his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is with vs: namely, that this concupiſcence is truely ſinne, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſo taught the church in his tyme, as it appeareth in ſondrie pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. What diſcommoditte then can it bee to a Commonwealth, to haue the people true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught to knowe the greate corruption of our nature, or what benefitt can it bee that thei ſhould not vnderſtand their wretched e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. Surely none, but this, that for wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of this thei ſhould bee puffed vp in a pride of their owne free will and good workes, and ſo not to regarde the ineſtimable benefitt
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:19102:121"/> and comforte of the death of Chriſt. The Aduerſarie alleadgeth in deede, that if it be ſo that a man ſinne euen without conſent, that then a man is diſcouraged to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtaunce: for that no man ſaith he wil ſtriue againſt that whiche he can not auoyde: that is, about the reſiſtaunce of mortall ſinne whiche he can not auoyde, if concupiſcence be ſinne, and euery ſinne be mortall. I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere not withſtandyng bothe theſe be true, as thei are moſt true, that yet the courage of reſiſtaunce is not hereby taken awaie. For the Apoſtle that confeſſed and taught bothe, though he founde it a tedious combate, and ſweate in a maner water and bloud vnder his Harneſſe, ſo as he complained ſomety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, that he ſawe a lawe in his members leading in captiuitie the lawe of his mynde, and in this regarde cried, O miſerable man that I am who ſhall deliuer me from this bodie of death: deſiryng hereby as it were the ende of his warfare: Yet did he not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore giue ouer the fielde, and yeeld hym ſelf to ſinne. Naie, rather the newe or the yong man whiche God had begotten in hym by his ſpirite, valiauntly behaued himſelf in the battell, oftentymes puttyng his aduerſarie to the flight, and by faithe aſſuryng hymſelf
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:19102:122"/> of the victorie in Chriſt Ieſu. And euen as a worthie knight and Champio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged with the valure of his enemie, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reioyceth in it, knowyng his victorie ſhall be the greater: So thei that are not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes in this ſpirituall warre but valiant in Chriſt, their noble courage is ſo much the more ſtirred vp as thei ſee their enemie to be great and mightie, that the honor of their victorie and triumphe in Chriſt maie be the greater. Wherby it appeareth that our doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine can in no ſorte bee any hinderaunce to vertue, or incourageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to vice. But theirs muſt needes bee a great breeder of vice and extinguiſher of vertue, whiche perſwadeth men that that is no ſinne whiche is in deede ſinne. For hereby thei neglect the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and open the firſt doore and entraunce freely vnto ſinne, which it were the beſt ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall pollicie to reſiſt in the beginnyng: whereof thei muſt needes be carefull which know it to be ſinne, and the other ſecure and careleſſe whiche take it to bee no ſynne. Therefore, not ours but their doctrine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth a wide gate to ſynne: whiche is yet greatly enlarged by that he addeth in the ende of this Article, that no man will ſtriue againſt that whiche he can not auoyde. For
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:19102:122"/> if this be ſo, and that it is moſt euident, that while we liue we can not amende this rebellion of our corrupt nature to the law of God: then his councell is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giue ouer ſtriuing any more againſt ſinne, ſeeing they cannot with all their ſtryuing auoyd it. But we are otherwiſe taught, that tho we can not auoyde that ſinne dwell in our mortall bodies, yet to ſtriue that it doe not raigne nor exerciſe Dominion ouer vs, but that we ſtriue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte it euen to bloud, as the Apoſtle ſayth, and euen vnto death.</p>
            <p>In the tenth place,<note place="margin">10 Of reward of good and euill works in this life, &amp; in the world to come.</note> compariſon is made betweene our doctrine and theirs in the puniſhment of ſinne in this life, &amp; in the world to come: and the reward of holines in heauen. For the firſt he affirmeth, that we ſay only faith in Chriſt, is neceſſary for the obtaining of the forgiueneſſe of ſinne, and this he ſayth is an eaſie point. How eaſie it is, may appeare in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was to beleeue, that of his dead body there ſhould ſpring children like y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtarres of heauen for mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and that he ſhould haue a ſeed in whome both he and al nations ſhoulde be bleſſed. What diſcourſes would a natural
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:19102:123"/> man here make to hinder with himſelfe the credite of this promiſe. Howe manye ſtrong bulwarks and fortreſſes of fleſhe and bloud, and how many hie and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conceites of the naturall man: as the Apoſtle ſaith, were to bee ouerthrowne and beaten downe to the ground, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram</hi> ſhould beleeue this. And how much more that by the death of Chriſt Ieſu, we ſhould haue life euerlaſting, ſo many as beleeue in him, by his ſhame and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour glory and praiſe, by his woundse, the cure &amp; healing of ours, by his warres and agonies, quietneſſe and euerlaſting peace. Of all the things that God hath commanded, this moſt needeth the migh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty hande of God to worke it and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, as in deede of all other it doth giue moſt glory vnto him. But faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo eaſy a matter with them, they wel ſhew how little they vnderſtande it. For our doctrine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by fayth only in Chriſte, al our ſinns are forgiuen, I acknowledge it to be true, and glorifie God, who hath wrought in vs by the powerfull work of his grace ſo to beleeue. For this is our peace with him. That this doctrine is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and true, it appeareth in that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:19102:123"/> hauing confirmed that <hi>Abraham</hi> was iuſtified by fayth, inferreth vppon it that by the ſame, <hi>Dauid</hi> pronounceth men to be happy: namely becauſe true happines is in hauing our ſinnes forgiuen, which we attaine vnto by faith in Chriſt. Thus ſaieth the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> to him al the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets beare witneſſe, that forgiueneſſe of ſinnes is giuen to euery one that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in him. Therefore the doctrine is ſound and holy, which when we teach we declare alſo, in caſe of repentaunce, what the fruites are of this faith, whereby in deede we repent, namely, a ſorrow for hauing ſinned againſt God, which ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and woundeth the hart with a grief, &amp; deteſtation of the wickednes committed and kindleth in it a loue and deſire to doe thoſe thinges which God hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Finally ſuch are the effectes of this fayth in repentaunce, which the Apoſtle noteth to haue beene in thoſe of <hi>Corinth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</note> As for auriculer confeſſion, which enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth men of neceſſitie to confeſſe their ſinnes one by one in the Prieſtes eare, we teache it in deede, for no parte of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce, becauſe wee haue no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, promiſe, nor example for it.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:19102:124"/> In deede, we bynde not men to this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſal and diſcouerie of their ſinne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the miniſter, which we eſteeme to bee but a very tiranny ouer the conſcience, and exhort them onelye according to the example of <hi>Dauid,</hi> to make their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe knowne vnto God which ſuffiſeth. Yet if any bee ſo tempted as he ſtandeth in need of councel &amp; of comfort, and ſhall open his hart to the godly and faithfull miniſter they are not denied the comfort that may bee giuen them in this reſpect, but vppon diſcerning of theire true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce. The miniſter is to aſſure his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience in his word of the forgiueneſſe of their ſinnes, declaring the promiſe of the Goſpell, which is of grace and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to all that doe repent. And this is the vſe of that, which Chriſte our Sauiour left vnto vs in the power of the keyes, in regarde of particuler comfort. A dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate imitation wherof, only is in their abſolution, which hee calleth a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without al reaſon. For a ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t being a ſeale of the Goſpell hath an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward creture applied to aſſure y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promiſe vnto vs, which ſhoulde haue ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blaunce
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:19102:124"/> to the promiſe which is ſealed by it, as we ſee to be in the water of baptiſm and in the bread and wyne in the Lordes ſupper. Another part of repentaunce they make to be ſatiſfaction. concerning which we teach that if it haue regard to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> partie inquired, be it eyther any priuate man, or the whole congregation offended by ſo notorious offence: then we teache I ſay that the diſcipline left vs by our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt doth require it. For in ſuch caſe bindeth that of our Sauiour, tell the Church, and, leaue thy gift at the alter, and be firſte reconciled to thy brother: much more therefore to the brotherhood, which is the church and the felowſhip of all the brethren. As for ſuch a ſatiſfaction as he mencioneth here of ſome temporall puniſhment in this lyfe, to ſatiſfie the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God for ſinne, wee affirme and that moſte truely according to the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that whatſoeuer is imagined of ſuch ſatiſfaction is highly derrogatory to the precious death of our Sauiour Chriſte, who onely is the ſatiſfaction for our ſins. which one point of their doctrine decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, they little vnderſtand what the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God and what ſinne is, that think
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:19102:125" rendition="simple:additions"/> it may ſo eaſely be ſatiſfied for. He na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth three ſatiſfactory workes, of praier, almes, &amp; affliction of the bodie, wherby he ſaith they ſatſfy for their ſins, which are euen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> depths of ſatan in this <hi>Rom.</hi> ſaith. For what may be more derogatory to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> croſſe of our ſauiour Chriſt and his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice once offred vpon it for all, wherby he hath fully ſatiſfied for the ſinnes of al that ſhall be ſaued, and payed the vttermoſt farthing of their debt: then that a man ſhould take that vpon him, which neither man nor Angell were able to beare, that is to ſatiſfie for his ſinnes. To whom it may be truely ſaid which the prophet <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie</hi> ſaide to the hipocrite people of his time, <hi>That is, colour thy ſynnes neuer ſo well, yet how ſhouldest thou ſay, I haue not defyled me, I haue not followed straunge Gods, beholde thy way in that valley, know what thou hast done: Washe thy ſelfe with Snow water, and make thee cleane with ſope, or the fullers ſcouring Hearbe, yea gylt thy ſelfe ouer with Goulde.</hi> And as <hi>Iob</hi> when hee had another manner of feeling of ſinne, and of the gilt of man in the ſight of God, then they ſeem to haue when they haue done all their ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory,

Almes is a duety which God hath commanded in thankfulneſſe of the loue and fauour we haue receiued of him, to be mercifull to ſuch as ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd in need of our help, but by ſatiſfiyng by them the iuſtice of God, is a thing which the prophetes of
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:19102:126" rendition="simple:additions"/> God &amp; the Apoſtles of Chriſt neuer knew of. The affliction of the body is a bodily exerciſe, whereof the Apoſtle ſayth it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth little: yet being diſcreetly vſed, may bring ſome helpe and furtheraunce to the making of men fitter for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeruice of God Not that the greater the affliction of the body is, there the mind doth alwais moſt ſerue him. For the prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> and the prieſts in the Weſt Indies, (as the holy ſtorye of the Kinges, and the ſtoryes of theſe Indies declare) exceede in the affliction of the bodye, yet bothe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and heatheniſhe Idolaters. So likewiſe the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> and ſome other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh orders of Friers (notwithſtanding they be but al counterfeits to the prieſtes of <hi>Baal</hi> and to the <hi>Indians</hi> in afflicting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues) make ſome hipocriticall ſhewe hereof, and eſpeciallye in the ſtreetes where they may be ſeene of all men, and yet are ſuperſticious idolaters. Therfore the ſeruice of God is nothing at al to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed to ſtande in theſe thinges. But there may be ſome exerciſe of the body, as faſting and watching at praiers and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſuch like exerciſes, which beeing vſed, with iudgement, not to hurte
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:19102:126"/> offence, or diſabling of the bodye to ſerue God: in the calling he hath called vs vnto maye bee ſome helpe to the ſubduing of the fleſh and the quickning of the ſpirite. Thus I ſaye, the exerciſe and affliction of the body, may be as the Apoſtle ſaithe, a little profitable for the ſubduing of our corruptions, and the ſtirring of vs vp the better, to the ſeruice of God. But to ſay that anye ſuche affliction, can releaſe our ſinnes, or ſatiſfie the iuſtice of God, or preuent anye paines of the worlde to come, by hauing borne a parte of them in this life, as this pretended Catholique doth teach, is blaſphemy againſt the ſonn of God, degatory to the ſatiſfaction made by him vpon the croſſe, and full of pride, vanity, and hypocriſie. Therefore concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning theſe three works, as al others like vnto them. I graunte they are in Chriſte acceptable deeds, which the true and liue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly faith worketh in thoſe whiche doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue: but which in no ſort ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſatiſfy God for our leaſt offence.

Let them truſte to theire owne praiers, Almes deedes, and patience, our truſt is that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and obedience of Chriſt, that his moſte holye Paſſion and ſuffering, which he ſuffered once for all vppon the croſſe, ſhall be oures by fayth, and that by this faith, we ſhall bee bothe iuſt and liue for euer, And this is our hope, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vp in oure heartes, by the ſpirite of grace to the daye of oure redemption: other confidence or meanes of ſatiſfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion haue wee not. As for purgatorye wee doe not in deede acknowledge, as he obiecteth to vs, but hold it to be a méere fancy of their owne, hauing no one title of the ſcripture for ground thereof. But oure authoure wil ſaye, notwithſtanding this doctrine bee falſe, yet muſt it néedes bee greatly profitable, to the reſtraining of men from ſinne, when they ſhal thinke
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:19102:128"/> that ſinne is not eaſily releaſed, but muſt be ſatiſfied ſo hardly for, euen in this life, and the reſt of the ſatiſfaction (as if they would pay al their owne debts to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt farthing) to be made in purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Is not this at leaſt a politique way to withholde men from iniquity. I anſwere there can be no way or meanes fit for the ſubduing of ſinne in deede, but onely that which God hath appointed. The weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of our warfare, <hi>are not carnall,</hi> ſaith the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle. <hi>We striue not against ſinne with ſuch weapons, as the vaine diſcourſe of a naturall man would thinke ſo to be fit for it.</hi> But wee repaire to the armory of the ſanctuary, and temple of the Lorde and there what weapons wee finde the Lorde hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to furniſh vs with againſt it, with thoſe we arme our ſelues, and ſtriue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinn and al our enemies. And ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie it is for all thoſe whoſe eies God hath opened, to ſée the truth that this deuiſe of theirs ſmally auailed. For with this they had another alſo, that theſe ſatiſfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory pains of ſinne, either in this life, or in their faigned Purgatorye, might by pardon from the Pope bee releaſed, and likewiſe blaſphemous to the croſſe
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:19102:129" rendition="simple:additions"/> and ſufferings of Chriſt, who taking vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to command the angels of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe to goe fet out of purgatory ſuch ſoules as he would appoint, and being a matter but of ſmal coſt, to obtain in their courts, ſo muche Lead and Wax as mighte ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them, and exempt them from al theſe paines, What redier way might there be made for ſinne then this? For if for mony a man may ſatiſfye for ſinne, whiche his owne life, nor the life of his onlie begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſonne cannot redéem him from, as the Prophet ſaith, this coulde reſtraine none but beggars from ſinn. for the rich few of them were ſo couetous, the popes pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s being ſo cheap as they were, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſmal a peece of mony, they wold be in danger of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fier or water of purgatory. For whether it be water or fire, or what kind of paines are in it their doctors are not yet reſolued. It appeareth then that for reſtraint of ſinne, it was no way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, but rather a moſt ſubtle deuiſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuil to entice al men to wickednes. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce hath declared. For as it appeareth by compariſon of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of al ages ſince Chriſt, there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any more ſinful, for ignorance of God
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:19102:129"/> for ſuperſtition &amp; idolatrye, for ambicious and reuengeful warres, for treaſons, mur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ders, adultries, and a thouſand villanies in this kind, and finally in al impiety, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> age doth beſt witnes: wherin this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin moſt raigned, of ſatiſfactory works, &amp; of purgatory. Which came to paſſe both by the iuſtice of God, reuealing his wrath fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al falſ worſhip &amp; vngodly deuiſes of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his ſeruice, giuing theſe who had not regard to keep his holy wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhip, pure in honor, &amp; vndefiled, to pollute defile, &amp; diſhonor themſelues, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al vngod<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly &amp; diſhonourable luſts, to their iuſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion: and alſo by the nature of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine it ſelfe, which in effect, making the holy morral lawe of God, but as it were ſome penal ſtatute made by man, opened the dore wide to al wickednes and abomi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nation. Whereby it is euident howe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary this doctrin is to al chriſtian ſtates and common wealths whatſoeuer, whoſe end ought to be cheefly, that their ſubiects liue in al true religion and honeſty. But how vnfit ſoeuer it be for chriſtian K. and eſtates, I confes it was a very pollitique point of doctrine for the popes kingdome. For hereby he receiued a double commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:19102:130" rendition="simple:additions"/> Firſt that caſting by this means his feare vpon the ſimple and ignorant, he en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ioyed more quietly the poſſeſſion of his ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny ouer the Church, al men ſtanding in neede of his fatherhood, and fearing to prouoke him that had ſuche a power, to keepe them in purgatory ſtil, or to releaſe them. Another that by his pardons, and indulgences deliuering men fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this priſon which he had painted in their heds, he filled his coffers with treaſure. Where by he enioyed the more eaſely, al the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentmentes that he deſired, and was the better able to maintaine his proud Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> kingdome, againſt al power that ſhould riſe againſt it. And thus in reſpect of the maintenaunce of their owne king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, I thinke there was neuer ſo poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke a ſuperſticion and falſe worſhip in the world as this of the Ro. faith: which whoſoeuer try fro point to point, ſhal eaſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lie diſcern to be moſt true. To the further conſideration wherof, leauing the diſcreet Reader, I will procéed to the other point which remayneth, which is of the reward of good and euill in the worlde to come. Wherof our doctrine is ſayth he, that all the paynes of hell are equall, and that the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:19102:130"/> moſt wicked man that euer was, ſhal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure no greater torment, then he that is the leaſt offender, which his report of our doctrine is vtterly vntrue. Wherefore let him eyther iuſtifie this to be true out of the confeſſion of the faith of our Church, which he ought to doe if he chalenge vs for doctrine, and not to charge vs with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing which hath beene written by any y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> profeſſe the goſpell, or by any wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ours of credite in the church: or let him feare with out repentance &amp; ſatiſfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for it, by confeſſing his ignorance or malice, in thus ſlaundering the church of God, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iuſt condemnation of lyars &amp; falſe witneſſes, whoſe porcion is with hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites. He ſaith we teach further alſo that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory of al the redeemed &amp; elect of God, ſhalbe equal, &amp; that euery one ſhalbe in as great glory as <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>Paule,</hi> which is not the general doctrine of our Church. Wee acknowledge that they which otherwiſe ſhal be beautifull as the firmament, and they which iuſtifie manye, ſhall ſhine is <hi>Daniel</hi> teacheth, like the ſtarres of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Our ſauiour denied not that there ſhould be a place at his right hande, and at his left, in his kingdome in the worlde to
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:19102:131" rendition="simple:additions"/> come, but in this worlde tolde his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that the pompe of earthly ſtates ſhold not be ſeene in him nor in his miniſters. He promiſed vnto the Apoſtles ſeates to ſit vpon, to iudge the <hi>12.</hi> Tribes of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell.</hi> And the Apoſtle reioyced in the hope hee had that the <hi>Theſalonians</hi> ſhoulde bee his Crowne in the daye of the Lorde. Whereby it appeareth, that as all the members are partakers of the power of the ſoul, and haue their place and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the body, yet they receiue not all power to doe the ſame worke, nor are of like honour: ſo in the miſticall bodye of Chriſt, al ſhal be as members of him, par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>takers of his ſpirit, and be filled with it, for the full worke and honour of that part which they ſhal be in the body: but not al inabled for the ſame worke nor of like ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. But they wil ſay how can this be, except heauen be a rewarde due vnto the worke. I aunſwere that according to the ſame grace, that god giueth a diuerſe mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure of faith, &amp; according to the diuerſe meaſure of it, the fruits thereof, many or few in this life: ſo alſo he diſpoſeth of the degrees of glory in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> life to come. wherby it appeareth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as we truely deny all men</p>

            <p>Therefore, looke what profite a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Common wealthe maie receiue of the doctrine of the diffrence of glory and pain, in the worlde to come, it receiueth it of the doctrine whiche wee teache. Drawyng to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes an ende, our aucthour beginneth confuſedlie to heape vp many thynges to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, by whiche order one point might haue ſerued hym as well as the whole do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen. For in this tenth he hath dealt with the doctrines of Repentaunce, Confeſſion, Satiſfaction, Purgatorie, of Heauen and Helle.</p>
            <p>In the eleuenth whiche followeth,<note place="margin">Of workes, merite, freewill, and prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination.</note> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth of Workes, Merite, Frewill, and Predeſtination. Concernyng the doctrine of Predeſtination wee teache ſaieth he, <hi>In the Churche of Rome, that all the Sainctes of God, are Predestinate before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the worlde were laied.</hi> And I ſaie, we teache the ſame. Therefore our doctrine herein beyng the ſame, it muſt needes be no leſſe profitable to any ſtate then theirs, and ſo no cauſe of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon. Of Freewill we teache ſaieth he, <hi>That a man hath liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and freedome of his will, whereby beeyng preuented and aſſisted by Grace, he maie at his pleaſure doe any good Workes, or refuſe
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:19102:132"/> to doe them.</hi> This doctrine in deede is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ours, nor the doctrine of Chriſte and his Apoſtles. For, accordyng to the truthe wee haue receiued of theim, we teache that the Nature of man through the ſinne of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam is ſo wholy corrupted, that there is no good thyng in it, that of it ſelf it cannot thinke a good thought, that it is ſolde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſinne,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. Rom. 7.8. Epheſ. 2.</note> and that it is enemy againſt God is not ſubiect to the lawe of GOD, nor in deede can be made ſubiect: finally, that we are borne dead in our ſinnes. Whervpon it followeth, that the will of manne beeyng a principal power of his ſoule, it is ſubiect to the corruption of the whole, and therefore hath no will to do that whiche is good, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not of it ſelf any good, is ſeruaunt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſinne, willeth nothyng but ſinne, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemitie with God: willeth not that whiche the Law co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth, but is dead in ſinne. Whereof it muſt needes followe, that wee are not free in our will, to will that whiche is good, for our will is ſeruaunte to ſynne, and therefore can not dooe the woorke of righteouſneſſe: Our will is deade in ſinne, and therfore can not be a liue to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. For as a deade man can not dooe the actions of a man that liueth, no more can
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:19102:132"/> the man that is deade in ſynne, doe any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of will, or any other that he doeth that liueth to God. I meane not that our will is dead altogether, no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that a man deade in his ſynnes, ſhould not liue the life of a naturall man, and of this worlde: but that whatſoeuer naturall power it hath, it is dead as touchyng the doyng or willyng of any thyng that God hath commaunded, in ſuche ſorte as the lawe requireth. There remaineth ſtill, notwithſtandyng the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhement of the ſynne of Adam, a will in man, whereby he is freely and willyngly carried to that he doeth, but this will I ſaie is of it ſelf, carried willyngly to no good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but onely and alwaies to euill. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beeyng deade, in reſpecte of any good, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after the will chuſeth well, this worke we teache not to bee of Grace, preuentyng and aſſiſtyng, but to bee wholie the woorke of grace. For, as if the ſpirite of life ſhould reenter into a deade man, who after ſhould riſe and walke, and dooe other thynges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeyng to a liuyng man, it can not bee ſaied theſe actions proceade partely from the ſpirit, whiche is inſpired into him, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the deade bodie. For, what helpe or furtheraunce can death bryng to an action
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:19102:133"/> of life. So alſo the Spirite of God reente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng into vs, who are borne dead in our ſynnes, and wee after liuyng in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the life of GOD by the ſame ſpirite, it cannot bee ſaied that our will chooſyng to doe that whiche is good, or any other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall facultie, dooyng in any meaſure the will of God, that it doeth it partly of it ſelf, partly of the ſpirite inſpired into vs, but the honor of ſuche actions is wholy due to that ſpirite. That wee will is of our nature, but that our will doeth will that whiche is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and good, is not partly of vs, and partly of the Grace aſſiſtyng, but it is wholie the woorke of Grace. Yet is it the goodneſſe of God to call it ours, that is wrought in him by vs, becauſe it is not wrought without vs, neither are we as an axe or deade inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Lordes hande, but the powers of our naturall ſoule tendyng of theim ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, wholy to that whiche is euill, are tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the grace and power of God, to that whiche is good. Whiche doctrine as it is moſte true, ſo doeth it giue to God the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour whiche belongeth vnto him. Neither is it a hinderaunce to good woorkes, that God be acknowledged the onely aucthour and woorker of theim. But ſaieth he more
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:19102:133"/> like a Philoſopher and naturall man, then a Chriſtian and a Diuine: except it bee in a mannes power to doe well, it muſt needes vtterly diſcourage hym from doyng good workes. The anſwere wherof is, that thoſe whiche beleeue, cannot but bee fruitfull in good woorkes, notwithſtandyng thei dooe not to the diſhonour of GOD, arrogate to themſelues the praiſe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For as a man that is quickened with a liuyng ſoule, can not but doe the woorkes and actions of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng man, ſo alſo thei which haue receiued the ſpirite of Chriſte, whereby thei haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, notwithſtandyng thei bee not inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by this reaſon vnto it, that of their former deade nature thei are able to heare, ſee, or vnderſtande, yet of the nature of that ſpirite, thei cannot but dooe the actions of that life, whiche that ſpirite doeth quicken and animate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> withall. And as a branche of a wilde Oliue taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his owne ſtocke and implanted into a naturall Oliue, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandyng that of it ſelf, it bring no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of helpe to beare a right Oliue, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whatſoeuer power is in it, is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie therevnto: Yet of the nature of the right Oliue, it cannot beeyng a liuely braunche of it, but beare right Oliues. Euen ſo it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:19102:134"/> with vs.<note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> For, wee are by nature wilde Oliues, and our Sauiour Chriſte is the true and naturall Oliue Tree, into whom beyng grafted by faithe, ſhall we ſaie it wil neuer beare any fruite, excepte the former wilde and ſauage nature it had before in his owne ſtocke, maie bee furtheraunce to it? No, but that nature beyng mortified and altered by the power of the true Oliue, we cannot beyng liuely braunches in this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue of GOD, but we muſt beare right and kindly fruites, accordyng to the nature of the ſtock wee are receiued into. Further, as the nature of the ſpirite whiche wee are vouchſafed doeth leade vs to it, ſo our inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour is ſtirred vp herevnto in tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kfulneſſe vnto God for our ſaluation, whiche he hath aſſured vnto vs by the power of the ſpirite, giuen vs to the daie of our rededemption. Therfore, becauſe we owe our ſelues who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vnto hym that hath ſo derely bought vs, and ſo graciouſly ſaued vs, we are to apply our ſelues to all good workes wherby God our redemer, may be glorified in vs. Whoſe glory if it be precious in our eyes, as it wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thely ought to bee more then heauen and earth, wee cannot want prouocation to doe thoſe thinges, which he hath commaunded.</p>
            <pb n="279" facs="tcp:19102:134"/>
            <p>Now for the laſte poinct of this Article of merite, and the reward of heauen: we ſay in deede that the doctrine of Merite, and to teach that life euerlaſting ſhould be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward deſerued by our good works, is a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine that maketh voyd in effect y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of Chriſt. The benefite whereof by this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſhalbe onely this, to procure vs this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with God, that vppon condition that we doe ſuche and ſuche woorkes, that then he will giue vs his Kyngdome for our woorkes ſake: whiche is a doctrine that of al other doeth moſte diſcouer Antechriſt as it is moſte oppoſite to the doctrine and honour of Chriſte. For, wee are taught by hym, that when wee haue doen all wee can doe, wee are to acknowledge that wee are but vnprofitable ſeruauntes: and thei teach that their ſeruice is worthie a reward, and what reward, of the kyngdome of heauen, the glorie of God, and of ioyes euerlaſtyng and vnſpeakeable. Thei teache theſe thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to bee but a ſmall purchaſe, a little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney giuen to their Corban, the buildyng of a Monaſterie or Abbey, for a ſort of Idle and Superſticious Friers to abuſe the world, and thynges many tymes of the iuſt deſert of euerlaſtyng death, to bee the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:19102:135"/> price of Gods kyngdome: that is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that an Abbey, a Seminarie College, or ſuche like, ſhould be as muche worthe as the precious bloud of the Soonne of God. Thus in deede we teache not, nor whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhould become of all the ſtates of the worlde, ought not to teache it, beeyng the proude doctrine of that preſumpteous An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techriſte, guiltie of hye treaſon againſt the Imperiall ſtate croune and dignitie of the kyng of heauen and earth. Whoſe fauour and grace, if we ſhould ſaie wee had deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, we ſhould account it little worthe, and ſhould take from hym his moſte due and high honour of our ſaluation, and be moſte vnworthie his grace beſtowed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. But ſaieth he, who will be zealous of good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, if there be no reward of them in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I aunſwere, if there were none, yet ought wee in thankfulneſſe to GOD for our firſt Creation, diligently to applie our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to dooe his will, and obeye his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes: As alſo all cteatures ſett forthe his glory in their kinde, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng there bee no rewarde promiſed them in heauen. But I ſaie further, that wee doe not teache that there is no reward for good workes, but contrariwiſe, that the reward
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:19102:135"/> of them is ſo exceedyng greate in heauen, that no good deede ſhall bee loſte, no not to the beſtowyng of a Cupp of cold water, in the name of a Diſciple. For as the ſonne &amp; heire of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father for al his ſeruice, receiueth a moſt large recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his inheritance: ſo muche more the inheritaunce of GOD muſt needes bee a moſte bountifull recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of all our ſeruice to hym. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandyng, the inheritaunce is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted due to the natural child fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for any deſert of his, but becauſe he is his ſonne. So likewiſe the inheritaunce of Gods kingdome, yea (muche leſſe without all compariſon) neuer can be earned by vs, or deſerued by any workes we can doe, but ſhalbe giuen vs becauſe we are ſonnes, and heires to God by faithe in Chriſt Ieſu. So the inheritaunce is bothe a gifte and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde: a gifte becauſe it is in euery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecte vndeſerued, and a rewarde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he that hath dooen nothyng in deede, but endeuoured to doe ſome ſmall parte of his duetie, and yet receiueth that whiche could not be due vnto hym: cannot ſaie that he is vnrewarded. And thus our Sauiour teacheth in the Goſpell, that the penie was the reward, and the penie was giuen hym,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:19102:136"/> that bare no heate and burden of the daie, but wrought onely one hower. An howers worke could not deſerue the wages and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appointed for hym, that ſhould worke the whole daie: yet he receiuing it of meere gift, can not ſay but that his howers labour was moſte bountifully rewarded. Euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyng life was promiſed to the doers of the Lawe, this worke wee doe not, yet it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God of his goodneſſe, to giue as well to vs that haue not doen it, as if wee had doen it, can we ſaie then that any thyng we haue dooen is lefte vnrewarded? Thus it is plaine, that giuyng to God the honour, whiche is due vnto hym, wee acknowledge alſo the reward to be great in heauen. And therfore though we doe not incourage any mercinarie duetie, but exhorte to a thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and cherefull obedience vnto God, yet the benefite that maie ariſe to any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealthe by this doctrine, that our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſhall not be loſte in the Lorde, is to bee reaped of the doctrine that we teache.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the twelueth and laſte Article, whiche is of Eareſhrifte, or Auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Confeſſion.<note place="margin">12. Of auriculer confeſſion.</note> Concernyng whiche thei teache it to bee neceſſarie for euerie Chriſtian manne, once in the yere at the

And this he ſaieth is the very hedge and wall of all vertuous and good life, whiche he pretendeth to proue by many particularities, but firſt for their doctrine: the vſe and benefite of it ſhall bee after examined. And firſt I wiſhe them to agree amongeſt them ſelues, that it maie bee determined betweene them whether it be of the Commaundement of God or not: or rather howſoeuer thei agree or diſagree I affirme it hath no maner of ground in the worde of God. Where we are onely taught to confeſſe our ſinnes vnto GOD, and to poore out our hartes before him, that the Lorde maie bee mercifull vnto vs. Further alſo in the publique congregation bothe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the reſt of the Church, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulerly vppon repentaunce of ſome noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious offence: and priuately one vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And therein wee receiue and finde tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe the good bleſſyng of God great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte and commoditie in vſing of them. But this confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that a man ſhould rehearſe in
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:19102:137"/> a Prieſtes eare all his ſinnes once a yeare. Neither was it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded of our Sauiour Chriſte, nor vniuerſally vſed in the Weſt Church till about <hi>300.</hi> yeares agoe. And if this be the very lock of all honeſtie and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue as he ſaith, and the very hedge of wel do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng, how could ſo many Churches &amp; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian States haue wanted it ſo long? Was there no vertue nor honeſtie for <hi>1200.</hi> yeres after Chriſt in ſuch places as had not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it? It is not to be thought to come to his commodities, that thei wanted meanes for redreſſe, both of priuate and publique offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces all that while. Neither doth the Goſpell whiche teacheth no ſuche matter as this is: Leaue the Church vnfurniſhed of meanes, to redreſſe all offences that come to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: which is by the godly exerciſe of that lawfull diſcipline, whiche our Sauiour Chriſt appointed to be vſed in his Church: whiche in deede is bothe the locke and keye of al good life next to the power of the word preached. Whereas therfore we are taught by the Goſpell to preache ſaluation to thoſe which beleeue and walke accordyng to that faithe: and contrariwiſe deſtruction to come vppon euery ſoule that ſhall not beleeue nor walke accordyng to the commaundement
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:19102:137" rendition="simple:additions"/> we haue receiued: and to denounce this to all Eſtates and Dignities, to thoſe whiche are of priuate and publique calling, who can not but finde them ſelues to be ſummoned by it to the tribunall ſeate of God, and haue their hartes oft touched withall to true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce. It can not bee ſaied then (without this newe founde deuiſe of auriculer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion) wee haue no meanes of good life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt vs.<note place="margin">Heb. 4.</note> The liuyng worde of God that ſtriketh deepe to the partyng betweene the ſoule and the ſpirite, ſhall it be eſteemed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng worth without this Confeſſion. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by this wrought through the grace of God, ſuche a compunction in the hartes of <hi>3000.</hi> in one daie, that thei came and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them ſelues in true repentaunce, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged their ſinnes in hauyng cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Sonne of GOD, and receiued the Faith and Baptiſme, in the name of Chriſt. Many ſuche like examples might bee vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out of the Scriptures of mightie and powerfull workes and effectes of the word preached. Whereby it appeareth, that the Churches wherein it is truely taught, as by the grace of God it is amongeſt vs, are not without not onely ſome, but not with out the cheefeſt and moſt principall meanes
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:19102:138"/> to keepe the people of God in due obedience of hym. For further meanes of diſcipline, as we acknowledge what the right order is whiche God hath commaunded, and bothe ſee and are hartily greeued to ſee in ſo noble a parte of the Churche as this is, and after ſo long continuance of the Goſpell prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched amongeſt vs, greate abuſes contrarie vnto it: So wee ceaſe not to bee moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and continuall ſuters to God and to the authoritie he hath ſet ouer vs, that we maie enioy it. Which being in the vſe thereof, and in the ordinaunce of our Sauiour Chriſt, ſo neceſſarie for the ſeruice of God, and the ſaluation of men, wee hope that the equitie and neceſſitie of that wee ſue for beeyng throughly vnderſtood, the Lord wil diſpoſe the hartes of ſo Chriſtian authoritie as wee are ſubiect vnto, moſt willyngly to graunt it. For want whereof, as your HH. ſee how wyde the enemies mouth is opened againſt vs, ſo the humble and dayly ſute of all that feare GOD and vnderſtande this matter within this lande is, that it maie pleaſe God to touche your HH. hartes with that zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous care of his glorie and loue of the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people, that by your HH. mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to her moſte excellent Maieſtie, order
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:19102:138"/> maie bee taken for the eſtabliſhyng hereof. In the meane ſeaſon we haue to aunſwere our Aduerſarie in this caſe, that the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell by the bleſſing of God, maie be of power to thoſe in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God ſhall worke by it, to keepe them in his feare. And for the regiment of the churche, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> abuſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theirs, that thei of all other haue not to charge vs in this reſpect.

So doth alſo the experience of theſe <hi>300.</hi> yeares wherein it hath been ſo vniuerſally commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded &amp; practiſed, which hath diſcouered it to haue been one of the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt inſtruments of Sathan, for nouriſhyng and maintainyng all the abhominations in theſe partes of the world, and the very ſeede of all priuate contentions &amp; publique war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of open violences and ſecrete treaſons. So that when I thinke of the conſequence of it: I maruaile how Chriſtian ſtates and people could indure it ſo long. By this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:19102:139"/> thei had the beſt intelligence of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſecretes of the publique ſtates in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, whiche thei traiterouſly vſed to the troublyng of the worlde and for their owne aduauntage. Thei ſearched and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by this meanes, bothe publique ſtates and priuate houſes, ſo as there was nothing in any Kyngdome, Citie, or Towne, no, nor in any houſe or familie but was knowne to them. Which was ſuche a politicke point in deede for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to keepe the world in awe of them, and to holde them ſtill in captiuitie, to ſett vp and put doune whom thei liſted, to make their freendes &amp; to ſubdue their foes, as a ſtronger wall for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maintenance of this Antichriſtian tyrannie could not be deuiſed.</p>

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:19102:139" rendition="simple:additions"/> iuſtly complayne that I haue followed impartiment matter, and left the ſtate of his queſtion, as he wrongfully chargeth the reuerend <hi>D. Fulke,</hi> whoſe learned wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings al the ſort of them will neuer be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with truth to aunſwere. Becauſe hee wold be anſwered to his mind, he is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful we ſhould vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his ful meaning: which is ſayth hee, not whether doctrine be true or falſe, theirs or ours: but whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bee more politicke or profitable to a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth: Wherin he is to be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, that to prooue his doctrin fitter for the eſtabliſhing of a K. and ſtate in peace wealth and honour, to bring vppon it all good promiſes and bleſſinges of God: his next and readieſt way had bene, to haue prooued the truth of it by the ſcriptures. For this is a moſt certain ground, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true religion hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promiſes of this life, &amp; the life to come: which are ſo farre in this life beſtowed vpon vs as God ſeeth to be moſt expedient, and may be without the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter loſſe and hinderaunce of the other. Therefore in leauing to prooue that, hee left the way he ſhould haue followed, and hath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a cleane contrary courſe, which is, that it bringeth greate commodities,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:19102:140"/> which if it were ſo, yet could not ſuffice to prooue it true. For the Turk and other heathen which apply their religion as may be fitteſt for the maintenaunce and ſecuritie of their ſtate, they receiue no doubt by their deteſtable falſe worſhippe, many benefites to the aſſuring of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates for a ſeaſon: yet is it but an execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble falſe ſeruice of God, which is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious vnto them. For whether com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities be bleſſings from God or no, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth vpon this, whether the people be his people, and honor him as he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. For to ſuch we are ſure, hauing warrant of the truth of religion, that all benefites are the effectes of the gracious promiſe of God to thoſe which feare him, and are in deed bleſſings proceeding from the tender loue of God vnto his people, and ſeales of the euerlaſting bleſſinges, promiſed vnto vs in his kingdome. But what bleſſing ſo euer is beſtowed vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, is turned in th'end into a curſſe, it is but feeding of the Oxe for the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a lifting of them vp, that when they are caſt downe they may fall with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter violence, and more eaſely be daſht in pieces. Finally it maketh them the more
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:19102:140"/> giltie, and bringeth a heauier deſtruction vpon them. For how ſhould they be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that feare not the Lorde, vpon whoſe fauour or diſpleaſure dependeth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity or hard eſtate of euery K: and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Therfore to perſwade that he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he hath taken a clean contrary way. For if a man graunt him al that he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, yet is it eaſy to aunſwere that this benefit in the end, muſt needes turne to a loſſe, and this ſhew of ſecuritie to all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe, this ſetled eſtate to captiuitie &amp; bondage. For how many exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples haue we of this fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, of K, &amp; common weales that haue flouriſhed for a ſeaſon, and in the end haue been broken al too pieces. As the ſtate of the K. of <hi>Tyre,</hi> which is deſcribed by the prophet, to haue been ſo exceeding proſperous, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in reſpect thereof, the King of <hi>Tyre</hi> for his glory is compared with the morning Star: yea &amp; ſayd, to ſhyne as a Cherub from amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the ſtones of fire, yet euen he as the ſame prophet threatned him is now caſt down from his high ſeat and from all his glory. And <hi>Tyre</hi> whoſe marchantes were as P. of the earth, and her chapmen as the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the worlde, is now become more
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:19102:141" rendition="simple:additions"/> like a poore fiſher Towne, then that olde Citie, or greatly renoumed amongſt the Ylands, and in al the world. We ſee the Ro. empire, and the K. of <hi>Italy,</hi> how not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the former honor, wealth, glorie of it, yet now, and that by the meanes of their Popedome, it is daſht in a maner all in pieces, &amp; cut into ſo many little ſeingnories Dukedoms, L, and free cities, that they are as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> potſherds of the earthen veſſell, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord as he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in the <hi>Pſalme,</hi> hath burſt in fitters with his barre of yron. Whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right way to prooue anye doctrine profitable for a chriſtian ſtate, to be receiued, to ſhew it to be of God. Other wyſe without conſideration of the truth of it, to ſay how falſe ſo euer it be, yet is it good for the ſtate, or how good ſo euer it be, yet is it ill for the ſtate, and wil bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouations troubles and pouertie, this is to reaſon like one that hath no God. And if he went to reaſon thus like an <hi>Atheist,</hi> hee were vtterly vnworthye any aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, and hath offered your Hh. the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt wrong that a chriſtian nobility could be offered, once to think, that the ſhew of his commodities to the ſtate, ſhould carry
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:19102:141" rendition="simple:additions"/> your H. to the liking of that falſe worſhip and ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is againſt God &amp; his holy truth. Therfore what ſoeuer he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to the contrary, the queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it bee good for a Chriſtian common wealth and kingdome, I haue anſwered pertinently in ſhewing theire doctrine firſt to bee falſe and hereticall. Which ground beeing firſt laid, I haue ioyned in that iſſue he deſired, declaring further, that as by the curſſe and wrath of God, which muſt needes ſhake and ouerturne the ſeates of ſuch mighty ones, as ſhall dare to haue wars with the almighty, in ſetting vp a falſe &amp; idolat. worſhip which he hath forbidden: So alſo that their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine it ſelfe and the practiſe of it in the very nature of them both is againſt all good pollicie of any Chriſtian ſtate, and onely fit for the eſtablſhment &amp; ſecuritie of their Antechriſtian kingdome. For fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther euidence wherof I haue thought good here to gather together (with ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of lyke matters) that hath bin touched in ſeueral places concerning this matter already. That being to be vewed in one ſight, it may the better be iudged and diſcerned. For better vnderſtanding
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:19102:142" rendition="simple:additions"/> wherof it is to be conſidered, that the good eſtate of a Chriſtian K. or common welth is to be holy in religion, and al duties im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately reſpecting God, honeſt in all conuerſation amongſt men, free for liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſtrong for forces, quyet for peace, and rich for treaſure. All which points make a ſtate honourable and happie. But the R. doctrine and practiſe, bringeth in a falſe worſhip of God, al wickednes &amp; looſeneſſe of life, tyrannie, bondage, wars, trouble, weakneſſe and vnhabilitie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the enemy, finally, néede and pouerty, all which muſt needes make any ſtate vnhonourable and vnhappie. That their faith is vnholy, &amp; therfore maketh their people ſuch that doth receiue it, appereth by the worſhip of Idols, of bread, of wood, and of ſtone, by the ignorance of all ſorts amongſt them, and the maintayning of it to be mother of deuotion, by their iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifications thorow their owne workes, and ſo many other bye means, beſids that only ſweete ſacrifice of Chriſt Ieſu: &amp; in a word by al their falſ worſhip, which is wholly nothing but a ſeruice deuiſed by men, and not preſcribed by the worde of God. And as in regard of God, it is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:19102:142" rendition="simple:additions"/> and prophane worſhippe, hauing no ground of his word, ſo is it the cauſe of al diſhoneſty and wicked conuerſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men. Which may appeare not onely in the iuſtice of God, with whom it is righteous, to giue ouer to all ſhame of iniquitie and abhomination, thoſe which haue not helde his honour in any due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, but haue made it common to Idols, and by experience which hath made proof of all vngodly and looſe behauiour, to bee euen in their holieſt Cloiſters: but alſo by their very doctrine and practiſe of it. This may eaſely be diſcerned by any that ſhall compare with that holy diſcipline which is taught in the Goſpel, their diſcipline, which is moſte looſe and deſolute, except it be, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which may keepe ſtill the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage and captiuity of ignorance ſuperſtition and Idolatry. For as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of Chriſt is the ſpeciall meanes next to the true preaching of the word, of all godlineſſe and honeſtie, both to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued amongſt men, and alſo to be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after a declination and decay, ſo that Antichriſtian diſorder and confuſion, in all the chiefe parts therof, is next to their falſe and hereticall doctrine, the greateſt
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:19102:143" rendition="simple:additions"/> cauſe, that all impietie and wickedneſſe both firſt entred into the Church and yet can not be driuen out, that the ancient e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the Church may be recouered and reſtored againe. But I will leaue other points which were to long to enter into here, &amp; note but one ſpeciall corruption of their diſcipline, Wherby iudgement may be giuen of the reſt. This is that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian ſupremacie wherby the man of ſinne in the deuiliſhe pride of his ſeat, challengeth vnto himſelfe fulnes of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſoueraintie of iuriſdiction, to doe what pleaſeth him, and to diſpenſe with what he liſt. For what greater encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement can there be to ſinne, then that a man may be ſure for a little mony, and a very little in deed, to haue a ſealed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, not onely for any wickedneſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but alſo for all he ſhall commit al his life and many hundreth yeares after: ſo fooliſhly and abſurdly wicked is their doctrine and practiſe. If a man by going a pilgrimage, or ſaying ſo many times o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his beades, or faſting ſo many dayes, or giuing ſo much to the prieſtes and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary men: If I ſay by theſe and ſuch like meanes a man may ſatiſfie for his
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:19102:143" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſinnes, who will be reſtrayned from any wickednes, or be careful of the amending of his lyfe. Thus one point of the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie is as a roote of wormewood and an original cauſe of an infinitie of tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; ſinns. Which being thorow the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God and the very nature of ſinne, enemy to al good pollices, whoſe end is to repreſſe ſinne, what neede we further proofe, that the practiſe of this Romiſhe religion muſt needes be the poyſon of all ſuch ſtates which doe receiue it. But no maruaile tho ſo infinite a power of the Pope be ſo great a cauſe of ſinne. For the very authoritie of abſolucion whiche e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Prieſte hath, is more fruitfull this way to encouragement and increaſe of wickedneſſe, then that any good ſtate or policie may beare it. I ſpeake not here of the daunger of diſhoneſtie and vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, by reaſon of their ſecreet confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For which that worthye <hi>Nectareus</hi> aboliſhed the vſe of it out of the Churche of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but of the power that they take vpon them to abſolue male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors from ſinne, wherby it muſt needs be greatly encouraged. That deſperate and Deueliſhe <hi>Iaureguy</hi> the <hi>Spanyarde</hi>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:19102:144" rendition="simple:additions"/> purpoſed to haue done vppon the noble Prince of <hi>Oraunge.</hi> For if euery Prieſt haue ſuch a power to abſolue from ſinne, any wicked limme of Sathan, that ſhall dare in his deuiliſh boldneſſe to attempt the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of miſchiefs againſt moſt H. perſonages, &amp; moſt noble Princes: what wickedneſſe is there that theſe abſoluers wil not diſpence with, and what ſecurity for any P. or ſtate where ſuch prieſts and abſoluters may be endured likewiſe their doctrin of ſatiſfactory workes muſt néeds be a great emboldning vnto ſinne. For if ſinne which the prophet ſaid could not be ſatiſfied for, tho a man ſhold giue riuers, of Oyle, and thouſands of ſhéepe, &amp; Oxen, yea tho he ſhoulde giue his firſt begotten ſonne, or his own life for the redemption of it: may ſo eaſely be redéemed, by giuing ſome part of the wicked mammon to buil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding of Abbeis, or maintaining of Maſſes ſeminaries, and ſuch like, which in deed greatly encreſeth their ſinn, by ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſuch abominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: Men muſt néeds bee hereby made more careleſſe of their wickedneſſe, and more encouraged to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend. Whervnto alſo their ſanctuaries &amp; priuiledged places do greatly encourage.
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:19102:144" rendition="simple:additions"/> For if any malefactor may haue any ſuch defence againſt all iuſtice and protection for his ill doing, how is it poſſible that all wickednes ſhoulde not be prouoked by it. Whereby it being plaine that impunitie is the cauſe of incouragement to offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and that the practiſe of the R. religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is thus diſcouered to be ſuch, as it ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the tranſgreſſor free from all feare of the wrath of God, and the iudgement to come, by their diſpenſations, indulgences abſolutions, and ſatiſfactory workes: and from all eccleſiaſtical puniſhment for a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle mony, by making markets of their ſaid Buls and pardons: and from the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the ciuill magiſtrats, by ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and in al their clergy, by exemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, imunitees, priuiledges, and appeals to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeate of <hi>R</hi> It muſt needes be hereby moſt manifeſt, that the practiſe of their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is as a breach that is made by the ſea, wherby al maner of impietie and wicked<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of life, doth ſo violently flow into the common wealth wher it is receiued, that it is not poſſible to make reſiſtaunce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. Whervpon I conclude, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by his owne confeſſion, this Romiſh fayth, in the doctrine and diſcipline of it,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:19102:145" rendition="simple:additions"/> both thorow the iuſtice of God, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but from heauen reueale his wrath vppon ſo great vngodlineſſe, and in the very nature and practiſe of their religion muſt néeds be the moſt certaine ruine and ouerthrowe of all K. and ſtates where it is eſtabliſhed. I might alledge here other particular cauſes of the breaches of ſome certain commaundement, as their diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered orders of Monkes &amp; Fryars, their vnlawfull vowes and conſtrained ſingle life, to be cauſes of hypocriſies, adultries, fornications, and a <hi>1000.</hi> abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of vncleannes. But I leaue theſe and ſuch like to the conſideration of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete reader, and proceede forwarde to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther points. Wherein I affirme the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of their religion, not to ſtand with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good pollicie. Next to the honor of God &amp; a vertuous conuerſation, wherof haue beene ſpoken alreadye, nothing can or ought to be more regarded in a ſtate, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſouerainty of the ſtate and freedome of the people. Which by the doctrin of the Goſpell is maintained and eſtabliſhed, For ſo we teach, according to the doctrine of the apoſtles, that euery ſoul and perſon be ſubiect to the ciuil magiſtrates: both to
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:19102:145" rendition="simple:additions"/> the K. as moſt excellent and ſouerain, and to thoſe which are ſent from him. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by both the ſouerainty of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtate is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, in directing &amp; commanding, with in the Dominion which God hath giuen them without controulment of any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine power: &amp; the lawful liberty of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For the people obeying the authority which God hath made them ſubiect vnto, they neede not to be ſuters for any cauſes in the court of any ſtraunge P. they are not to be taxed by them, but in euery their reſpect, are free from the bondage of anye forraine commaundement whatſoeuer. But the Romiſh religion, nether leaueth P. ſoueraine in their eſtates, nor the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple frée in their liberty. For by the doctrin and practiſe of their religion, K. and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are but vaſſals, and as feodataryes to the pope in their K. and dominions, they are to receiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of him, and leaue them at his pleaſure. Hee hath authority to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of all their Crownes and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, to ſet vppe and put downe as it ſeemeth beſt to him. And as this is ſet downe for good lawe in their Canons, ſo haue they not failed to practiſe it, as hath appeared. Further alſo, they take from
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:19102:146" rendition="simple:additions"/> them y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dealing with al eccleſiaſtical cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, drawing them all to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sea &amp; court of <hi>R.</hi> euen to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beſtowing of eccleſiaſtical li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings at his pleaſure, by means wherof, both the emperors of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> R. empire, &amp; other P. &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> K. of this la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, haue bin fain to plead ſuch cauſes as they haue had with their ſubiects without their own land. further alſo, they took vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to impoſe paime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts vpon their ſubiects (beſids a thouſand op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of their ſoules, which they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerablie tyranniſed, with lawes of abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence for conſcience ſake, from meates and from marriage, commaundemente of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſing their ſins in ſhrift, &amp; the reſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of their will worſhip) wherby the pore people were oppreſſed with great bondage and the P. were ſo manye and diuers waies impeached, in their crown and dignity. Further in a well pollicied eſtate it is required, that it bee maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in peace, and yet ſo, that in caſe of warre they may bee ſtrong, bothe in men and treaſure to defend and repulſe the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of their enemies. This the Goſpel teacheth, being the goſpel of peace, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men are not only reconciled vnto God, but alſo one to another, according to the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:19102:146"/> worthy teſtimonies, which both the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles beare vnto it in this behalfe. And as the Doctrine is peace, both with God, and amongſt men, ſo the practiſe of it can not in any ſort diſturbe or hazard the peace of the ſtate where it is receiued, but with al ſecurity eſtabliſh it. Likewiſe hath it nothing in all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrin &amp; practiſe of it, contrary to the ſtrength of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale. For it teacheth marriage to be honourable amongeſt all men, and the honour of a P. to be in the multitude of his ſubiects, and exempteth none by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pretended authority of forrain power, from the ſeruice of their country. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning riches &amp; treſure, it doth not impoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, requiring only a competent prouiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the paſtors and doctors of the church. Which as it is neceſſary for their ſeruice, and moſt due by the expreſſe commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, ſo riſeth it to no great char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of a common weal. But the R. religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; practiſe of it, is againſt al theſe. For if the ſtories euen of their own wickedeſt writers may bee credited, as they oughte moſt of al to be againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> B. of <hi>R.</hi> haue bin y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe of al the wars y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue bin in <hi>Europe</hi> theſe <hi>100</hi> yeres. And indéed
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:19102:147" rendition="simple:additions"/> what eſtate ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be in ſecurity or quietnes, wherein a forraine P. ſhall haue intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of all the ſecretes of the lande. But whereſoeuer the R. religion is, euerye Prieſte is an intelligencer and a ſpye for the pope, who both by other means, &amp; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cially by their auriculer confeſſion come to vnderſtand the deepeſt ſecrets of euery ſtate and K. of euery City, and town, vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, houſe, familye, &amp; perſon within the land. Which kind of intelligence, being y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt certain, as vttered of conſcience, and moſt priuy, as put only into a prieſts ear, &amp; ſo manye imploied herein, bringeth to paſſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no P. in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by al the means he can poſſibly vſe, of the affaires of the ſtate next to him, or with whom he hath moſt to do, which the pope hath of al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtates &amp; K. where his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is maintained. Which intellige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce as euery mean man may eaſily vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d being a matter of ſo great importance, in al cauſes publike &amp; priuate, it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſidered, howe eaſy a matter it is for him, by means herof to diſturb y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quiet eſtate of any natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or K. at his pleſure. For which cauſe of late, he hath ſent in new Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, ſhriuers and abſoluers, who vnder
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:19102:147"/> pretence hereof, may both vnderſtand the ſecrets of the land, and deliuer <hi>Agnus deis</hi> grains, &amp; medalls to his reconciled, as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of their conſpiracie. Whereby they maye bee prepared for a daye to riſe vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte the lande, &amp; diſturb the quietneſſe of it. Which is ſo euident a meanes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet a ſtate, as I eſteme that none which wil receiue their auriculer confeſſion can bee longer quiet then it ſhall pleaſe the Pope. Herevnto if we adioyne the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the infinite power, whiche moſt vngodly and iniuriouſly to al ſtates this R. church giueth to their pope, it wil eaſely appeare, how contrary their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and practiſe is to the welfare of all K. &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weales. For their doctrine is (as I haue partly touched before to ſhew the repugnance of popery, the hie autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and ſouerainetie of any ſtate, and here repeate becauſe the ſame is alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the peace and quietnes of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in certain caſes, the pope may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe P. fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their imperial ſeats &amp; thrones of iuſtice, and giue their crownes and K. vnto others. Their doctrine is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee may abſolue al ſubiectes of ſuch P. from their alleageance and oth made vnto them, yea
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:19102:148" rendition="simple:additions"/> that hee may excomminicate all ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects as ſhall obey the authoritie lawes, and commaundements of ſuch a Prince. And their practiſe agreeth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their doctrin For thus they dealt both with diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther P. here to fore, and thus alſo of late the impietie of <hi>Pius</hi> the fift, brake forth to the excommunicating and depriuing her Ma<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his proud bul much like the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous letters of <hi>Rabſ.</hi> ſent to king <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechias,</hi> (yea &amp; to the accurſing of all ſuch her graces loyal ſubiects, as according to their moſt bounden duety obey her whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome lawes and ſtatutes, in theſe words. We charge and forbid all and euery the Nobles, and ſubiectes) and people, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers afore ſaid, that they be not ſo hardy as to obey her, or her will or commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, or Lawes, vppon paine of like curſſe vppon them. Which clauſe of that preſumptuous and wicked writ, is ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant in the cauſe we are now in hand withall, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I deſire all thoſe that ſhal read this, to take good héede vnto it. For how can this author affirme that there ſhould be cauſe to tollerate the rebellious practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of this wicked forraine P. Seeing it cannot be in any reaſon that they can be
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:19102:148"/> faithful &amp; dutiful ſubiects to her maieſty, which obey this execrable bull. For he can not be a liege man nor a dutiful ſubiect of her maieſty, that will not obey her lawes and ſtatutes, and take her for his natural and lawful P. and much leſſe he that ſhal perſwade others herevnto. But none of thoſe which are reconciled to this their R church may doe ſo, and their prieſtes and ſeminarie men perſwade them there vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Therefore no ſuch reconciled papiſtes, much leſſe they which reconcile them can be good and obedient ſubiectes of her Ma. That ſuch as are reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciled to their church may not bee obedient to her H appeareth by the Popes bul curſſing &amp; excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating out of their church, al ſuch as do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey her H. laws, where vpon it followeth that they which are reconciled are recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled vpon that condition. For otherwyſe in caſe of their obedience they are accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but the reconciled are not in caſe of excommunication, therefore they haue denied their obedience. Howe can it bee then that this doctrine may be tollerated, that her maieſties ſubiects by ſuch means ſhoulde bee drawne from obedience of her lawes, and acknowledging her lawfull
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:19102:149"/> power ouer them without the certain ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of the ſtate. Chriſt and his Apoſtles neuer taught any ſuch doctrine or practiſe as this is. The primatiue Church neuer heard of it. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> that worthy biſhop of <hi>Millayne,</hi> When hee for a cruell murder and maſſacre of the Citizens of <hi>Theſſal.</hi> had excommunicated <hi>Theod.</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, yet did he not take vppon him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him from his Emperiall Crowne and dignitye, but howſoeuer in the charge of his miniſtery, hee declared him to haue no right to the Lordes table, and ſuche other Spiritual diet and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods children: yet as touching the things of this life, hee reuerenced his authority, and was obedient to him in all thinges. But of this practiſe of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Churche, except it be of their owne doing, I ſuppoſe there is no preſident to be ſhewed from Chriſt to this day. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as touching the ſtrength of a Lande to reſiſt her enemies, the practiſe of this Romiſh fayth, doth bothe weaken it for people, and impoueriſhe it for treaſure where it is receyued. This may appeare if we cal to minde that which hee boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of in this example, that is the greate
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:19102:149"/> number of Prieſtes, Profeſſors, Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and other ſuperſticious perſons, whom he falſly calleth religious, which waited and attended vppon them. The number wherof aryſeth by his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to ſo many thouſandes, and all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the ſeruice of the P. warres. yea and from anye contribution and payment to maintaine them, could not be but a great infeebling to the ſtate. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they al being reſtrained from marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, wherby either if they had no childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or not daring to auow then moſt cruelly murdered them, the poſteritie coulde not multiply any thing in ſuch ſort, as if it had beene lawful for them to marry. But this wiſe politicke eſteemeth it a high point of wiſdome, to diminiſh the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Chriſt. people, &amp; of the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which is promiſed as a bleſſing to be multiplied as the Starrs of heauen that cannot be numbred. Concerning the treaſure of the land, it is not his eating of whit meat that can reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence the great &amp; infinite ſummes of treaſure, which their pretended catholique religion by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand means drew from al the ſtates &amp; K. where it was receiued. For the ordinary
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:19102:150" rendition="simple:additions"/> reuenews and profits of their religious men, as he falſly calleth them, roſe here, to one third of all the land, &amp; more in the raigne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noble K. <hi>Henry</hi> the eight. The furniture of their churches with ſo many ſurpleſſes and Copes of all ſortes of riche ſtuffe, ſuch as no King or Prince coulde wear better then many of them were of. Their great and Maſſy croſſes of ſiluer &amp; gold, their Idols of fineſt mettals, &amp; moſt exquiſite workmanſhip, the rather to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the people, as if they had been aliue. Their other ordinarie charges of waxe, incenſe, Orgaines, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plate and Iewels of their Abbeys, Pryories, &amp; other ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious houſes were of infinite valure and price, as I think y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court of augmentation might ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly teſtifie. Beſide al theſe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> extraordinary charges of appeals &amp; folow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing ſutes at <hi>R.</hi> the paimentes impoſed by moſt tirannous oppreſſion, both of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king nobles, &amp; al the people of this land to their moſt iuſt and gréeuous complaint, (as ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pereth by their letters) drawn out of this &amp; other K. by names of <hi>Peter</hi> pence, <hi>Palles</hi> collatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, firſt fruits, &amp; a <hi>1000</hi> ſuch crafty and ſubtle titles &amp; moſt extreeme exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, did ſo impoueriſhe the ſtate, as both
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:19102:150"/> the K. the Nobles, and all the people did often and greeuouſly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine, as finding in deed the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the very leech that ſuckt the bloud of all the land, and could neuer be ſatiſfied. Of this we haue ſundry ſtatutes teſtifying the popes proceedings here to haue beene to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuming of the Kings perſon, the derogatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and miniſhing of the Kinges crowne and regalities, the deſtruction of the law and all his realm, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> appayring &amp; confounding of the auncient lawes, cuſtoms, vſages, &amp; franchiſes of the Realme. Further, that by them the nobilitie &amp; gentrie were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached in their Patronages and other rightes, The commons and ſubiectes tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed in body, and impoueriſhed in their goods, deuine ſeruice, Hoſpitallity and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſſe deeds hindered, the benefices of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church waſted and deſtroyed, the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and treaſure of the Realme carryed away, as alſo the leige Perſonnes of the Kinges councell with out his aſſent, whereby the Realme was left deſtitute as well of councell as of ſubſtaunce, to the deſtruction of the ſame.

Where accounting the Churches of the French tongue in the lowe Countries with them,<note place="margin">Le cabinet du Roy Des Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</note> the ordinary reuenue of the cleargie, came to about a two hundred Millians of French Crownes. <hi>Germany</hi> and the ſtate of the Empyre helde at <hi>Norinberge,</hi> made complaint of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Greuaunces, &amp; ſent a note of them to the Pope, with a requeſt to be eaſed of ſuche exactions and practiſes of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouerſhing the people, as the Pope and his cleargie did continually charge them with, and that the people might be left in their auncient and lawfull freedome and libertie by his meanes, or elſe they woulde aduiſe them ſelues how to helpe it: becauſe they coulde not nor woulde not anye longer beare ſuche theire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable burdens. Whereby it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare howe contrarye this Romiſhe doctrine and practiſe is, to all good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates and pollicies. In deede in reſpect of their owne Antichriſtian kingdome, I muſt needes confeſſe that for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, continuance, ſecurity, wealth,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:19102:151"/> and honour of it, there coulde nothing haue beene deuiſed more politique or fit, by anye Sathans meanes, (whoſe depthes, their Popes and Prelates vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood) then that which was deuiſed by them. For what coulde be fitter for them then this doctrine of the Popes ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie ouer all, of his fulneſſe of power, of receiuing both the ſcriptures, and their expoſition of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of obeying that hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, of not iudging him tho he carried ten thouſand to hell, of deuout ignorance, of iudging heretickes who ſo euer ſpake againſt them, of purſuing and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them with fire and ſwoorde, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, Auriculer confeſſion, priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his Cleargie, the Pompe and idleneſſe of his Hierarchie, and of all their moſt ſubtle and Serpentlike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triued falſe worſhip. The practiſes of <hi>Egipt,</hi> toyling <hi>Iſraell</hi> with all baſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and villanie, and of killing their male children, or of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> barbarouſe tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, of waſting the Weſt <hi>Indies:</hi> was not nor is not, more ſubtlely and diueliſhly deuiſed to detaine thoſe free Nations in perpetuall bondage and ſlauerie, then their Romiſhe doctrine and practiſe was
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:19102:152" rendition="simple:additions"/> to haue eſtabliſhed the kingdome of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, and to haue detained the people of God in euerlaſting ſeruitude and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie both of body and ſoule. Thus then we ſee that for pietie and true religion, the doctrin of the Church of Rome (that is in effect of the Pope who is ſteare man of this ſhippe). Concerning their power to make any writinges, Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall ſcriptures, to make new Articles of Chriſtian fayth, to appoynt God to be ſerued according to their owne deuiſes and imagination of men, of ignoraunce to be the Mother of deuotion, of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Idols, and Sauiours of ſo many ſortes, Finally of all their falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: is a Phariſaicall leauen to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out of all Chriſtian Churches, and ſtates, the Cup of ſpirituall fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that all Kinges and Princes are to take heede of, to bee partakers of it, that they bee not partakers of their plagues. And for Chriſtian honeſty of lyfe, and duetyes towardes men, their doctrine of abſolutions, of diſpenſations, of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions, and of Sanctuaries are (for the impunitie or eaſie diſcharge of all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors) ſo great cauſes of all abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:19102:152"/> and wickedneſſe, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerly, their ſundry rules and orders, of hypocriſie, contention and idleneſſe, their conſtrayned abſtinencie from marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, of all enormityes of vncleaneneſſe and infinite murders, and ſuch like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſes of ſpeciall offences: that the waters of <hi>Noe</hi> did not ſo high drowne all the olde worlde, as thoſe floudes of wickedneſſe which by ſuch occaſions had ryſen, did ouer flow all ſuch kingdomes and Nations, as this doctrine of theirs, like a Sea of ſinne mighte breake in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. For other thinges how much a doe haue our Pr. had to prouide by all the wyſedome that was poſſible to be vſed, to make lawes and ſtatutes againſt the daungers, that this their religion conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually threatned againſt the ſtate. They ſought to maintaine their lawfull and moſt iuſt authoritie, by forbiding appeals from their courtes by premunire &amp; other ſuch like ſeuere and rigorous lawes, yet neceſſarie for the garding of their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie from the breaking in of theſe men, whom yet no defence could hold out. They ſought to maintain y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wealth of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple &amp; ſubiects by lawes of mortuaryes &amp;
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:19102:153"/> other ſuch like neceſſarie lawes and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, leaſt theſe men ſhoulde draw all the riches of the land vnto them. And yet neither coulde the premunire ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently repreſſe their proud ambition, nor the mortmaine their inſatiable co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe. So that their wealth, intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and power conſidered, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to be the ſame mighty hand and ſtret<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched out arme of God, that hath deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vs: which freed <hi>Iſraell</hi> from the ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſh ſubiection of <hi>Pharao</hi> and of the land of <hi>Egipt:</hi> which being ſo, no maruail the Chriſtian princes, whoſe eyes God hath opened to ſee the light of the Goſpell, doe not tollerate theire Religion and the practiſe of it. For beſides the impiety of it: for which it is ſimply vnlawfull to tollerate their abhominable prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſeruice of God, as appeareth by the commaundement of the Sabboth, forbidding the breaking of the Sabboth day, in euery Sonne and Daughter, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Seruaunt and Mayde in <hi>Iſraell,</hi> with out exception of any, yea in euery ſtranger within their gates: it can not in any ſound reaſon or iudgement be borne with all, euen for the very annoyaunces
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:19102:153"/> and hurts, which it bringeth to the ſtates which doe admit it. Neither is his margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal note of the example of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great <hi>Turke,</hi> and of the Byſhop of <hi>Bungo</hi> ſufficient to perſwade the contrary. For firſt they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme not the manifold diſhonour where with their Romiſh faith diſhonoreth god and our Sauioure Chriſte. Then alſo I deny that eyther of both, ſuffer that doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and practiſe of theire Religion, as they teach and exerciſe it in theſe partes. For is it likely that they are ſuffered to teach that it is of the neceſſity of Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for euerye humaine creature to bee Subiect to the Pope, or that it ſhoulde bee in the Popes power to depoſe them at his pleaſure? Doe they ſuffer the Pope to challenge appeales to his Courte from them, to deminiſhe ſuche multitudes of their people, and to draw out the Treaſure of theire Countryes. No, none of all this, nor manye other ſuche like poyntes, which they eaſily ſee to bee preiudiciall to theire ſtates. But beeing Heathen and prophane Princes not regarding wherein they prophane the Honour of God, by theire <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. It may be they permit ſuch exerciſe
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:19102:154" rendition="simple:additions"/> of their ſuperſtitions to ſome fewe of theſe pretended Catholickes as are ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered amongſt them, as doth not in any ſort inda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger or hurt their kingdom. But our cauſe beeing ſo farre diuerſe as hath been declared, there is no reaſon why the <hi>Turke</hi> or the <hi>Pagane</hi> king of <hi>Bungoes</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould be any preſident to a chriſtian Princes, making profeſſion of the holy faith of Chriſt and the truth of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: or why their tollerating with a few in ſome pointes nothing preiudiciall to their eſtates, ſhoulde perſwade a bearing of ſuch pointes and practiſes, as in the nature of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouerthrow the ſtate, peace, authoritie, ſtrength, and wealth of the kingdom that ſhal receiue it. Therfore I conclude this point, that the doctrine and practiſe of the Romiſh religion, ſuch as it is at this daie, and hath beene ſome hundreth yeares paſt, beeing againſt the Lorde God and his annoynted Sonne Chriſt Ieſu, againſte his holy worde, the doctrine of the Apoſtles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, beeing againſte the good ſtate of any nation, Kingdome and P. that ſhall receiue it, hauing infinite occaſions of all wicked life, taking from them their chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:19102:154"/> royalties and dignities, oppreſſing the conſciences, ſoules and bodies of their people, hearkning out by thouſandes of intelligencers and ſpyes, the greateſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes of their K. diminiſhing by cunning practiſes, the number of theire people, and drawing oute the Treaſure of the lande to theire intollerable hindraunce, weakning and impoueriſhing of them, and their Subiectes, ought by the worde of God and in all ſounde Wiſedome, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or pollicye to bee eſteemed, and iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged contrarye to the honour &amp; glory of almightye God, the holye and honeſt conuerſation of Chriſtian men, contrary to the ſafetie, aſſuraunce, eſtabliſhment, honour, peace, ſtrengthe and riches of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerye K. and common weale. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of the whol epiſtle, Thus farre this inſtrument of the pretended Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, hath mainteined their cauſe to bee worthye more fauoure then it findeth, by the profite he would perſwade vs, that the K. faith woulde bring to this K. Now drawing neere to a concluſion, His full heart breaketh out into ſcornefull &amp; pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall ſpeeches. Wherein firſt he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth a diſputation, and after ſeeketh to mooue ſome compaſſion with a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:19102:155" rendition="simple:additions"/> complainte of imagyned tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, ſuffered by his companions for theire Religion. The reaſon of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt is pretended to be the want of the proceedinges that haue beene hitherto v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed towardes them, which is noted both in the miniſters and in the ſtate. To the miniſters he obiecteth, that they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſolliciting your honors againſte them, and that they dare admit no law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full tryall of the cauſe, they moue que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of vnto vs. For whom to aunſwere as I am bound in the Lorde, I take it to be a very ſurmiſe of his owne head, that there ſhoulde be any neere your Honors, continuallye ſtirring you vp to drawe out the ſwoord vpon them. But if any ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther publiquely by preaching, or priuatly beeing vouchſafed that fauour to haue ſpeech with any of your honours, do vpon iuſt cauſe put your Lordſhips in mynde of the greate and high calling you are called vnto, that you beare the ſwoord of God, a ſwoord of protection for the godly, and of vengeaunce for all the wicked, if they declare by the word of God, that here<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ticks which ſéek to ſeduce the Ll. people to a falſe worſhip, and to carry them from
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:19102:155"/> the ſeruice of the liuyng God to the adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Idolles, that traitours whiche prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe a withdrawyng of her Maieſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes from her obedience, and reconcilyng of them to a forraine power, are ſuche wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Malefactors, againſt whom this ſword of iuſt execution is to be drawne. Thei doe herein nothing vnlawfull, but diſcharge the duetie of good and faithfull ſeruauntes to God and loyall ſubiectes to her Maieſtie. For thus we reade it to be written, if a falſe Prophet ariſe vp amongeſt you: ſaiyng, let vs goe and ſeeke other Gods, that Prophet ſhall bee ſlaine, becauſe he hath ſpoken to turne you awaie from the Lorde your God, to thruſt thee out of the waie wherein the Lord thy God commaunded thee to walke, ſo ſhall you take the euill awaie forth of the middeſt of you. Of whiche ſorte thei are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted to bee, who leade men to the worſhip of Images, whiche is all one with other Gods and Idolles, how ſoeuer thei labour in vaine to diſtinguiſhe them. For if it were allowed them that Idolles were the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Heathen men, and Images the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaites onely of Chriſtian men (whiche is nothing ſo, for the wordes are indifferent to bothe) yet is the matter one and the ſame in
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:19102:156"/> effect. For whether a man giue the honour of God to the counterfect and reſemblaunce of a Heathen or Chriſtian, or to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures them ſelues what ſoeuer, it is all one. The rule is generall that he is gealous and will not giue his honor vnto an other. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the exhortation to the iuſt execution of ſuche falſe Prophetes is a duetie well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming a ſeruaunt of God. The other the Apoſtle alſo teacheth, affirmyng that thoſe which reſiſt the higher powers procure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them ſelues. And doe theſe men thincke that thei maie compaſſe Sea and Lande to ſeduce mens ſoules into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and Subiectes from their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obedience, and no man ſhould take héede to their doyng, and oppoſe hym ſelf to their wicked proceedynges? Yes the ſame God who is the watchman of Iſraell and ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth not, no nor ſlumbereth, I hope will ſtirre vp the care of all men accordyng to their callynges, to looke to the doynges of theſe buſie and ſedicious Seminariſtes, and to further ſuche lawfull iuſtice againſt them as they maye by their vnlawfull deedes make them ſelues ſubiecte vnto: and that your HH. accordyng to the noble care you haue had hitherto of the maintenaunce of
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:19102:156"/> Gods true Religion, of the ſacred perſon of her moſt excellent Maieſtie and of all the people (againſt al which thei haue wickedly ſet them ſelues) will ſtill holde your eyes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen night and daie ouer them to diſcouer the ſecrete practiſes of their enemies, and to bryng to knowledge and iuſtice their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and cruell deuiſes, whiche thei con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire of vnder pretence of their confeſſion. Concernyng triall of diſputation he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vs with two thynges, that wee refuſe all triall by writyng, preachyng, or lawfull diſputation: and that wee are readie onely when we haue the aduauntage. What triall he could make of any cauſe by preachyng I can not tell, except he haue a confidence in perſuaſible wordes of humaine learnyng, and ſuppoſeth that if it were as free for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to preach as it is for vs, that then thei ſhould worke miracles. For to trie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth of poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of Religion by preachyng, I think was neuer taken for any waie of triall ſince the Goſpell was firſt preached. Therefore, this part of their three waies he might well haue ſpared, except he hope of ſuche their abilitie. If he haue any ſuche confidence, he is to learne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Apoſtles preuailed not by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng in ſuche order, but that their ſpeeche
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:19102:157"/> was ſuch as caried with it an euidence read and vnderſtoode in the hartes of the hearers that thei ſpake by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirite of God. For their doctrine, as alſo our ſauiour Chriſts before, was with power, &amp; not as that of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes and Phariſes.

            <p>There were many eloquent Oratours, many profounde Philoſophers, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiſemen accordyng to humaine reaſon, when the Apoſtles were ſent to preache. And thei came againſt them, neither with perſuaſible woordes of mannes teachyng, nor with any depe Philoſophicall ſkill, nor with any greate reachyng witte, but with the worde of the Croſſe, as farre from any outwarde pompe of ſpeeche, as the Croſſe of Chriſt was fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any worldly honor. Yet by this woorde bare and naked in ſhewe, by this breathe of the Lordes mouthe, thei pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed againſt all the enemies of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and ſubdued the wiſe and deepe, the flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng and eloquent men, to the obedience of the faithe of Chriſte. Therefore, hauyng not this worde for hym, but againſt hym: if he had the tongues of Angelles, yet ſhould he no more preuaile to the ſubuertyng of

For triall by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputation it hath been admitted alwaies, and many tymes offered by the profeſſours of the Goſpell vnto them, and that in bothe ſortes of ſpeaking, &amp; writyng.

In Fraunce at Poyſſie, Theodore Beze, &amp; Peter Martir, men of rare excellencie of knowledge and vtteraunce, with ſondrie other worthy lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned menne, ſo diſputed this cauſe with the choiſe of Sorbone, and of all the Papiſtes of Fraunce, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cardinal of Loraine hym ſelf wiſhed that Beza y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> day had bin dombe, or ſome of his auditours (noting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefeſt) had been deafe: meaning thereby that God by him that daie had ſo laied open the truth and diſciphered their errours, as he feared leaſt thoſe that were in aucthoritie, ſhould
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:19102:159"/> haue receiued it. I leaue to mention the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputation of Zwinglius, Oecolampadius, and others at Bearne, Baſile, Strauſbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, and other free Citees. In all which the Lorde ſo aſſiſted his ſeruauntes, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpell, as vpon ſuche triall the truthe was found to be with them. And to ſpeake here of the like at home in Kyng Edwardes tyme, and alſo in Queene Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, when thei brought thoſe worthy men, and conſtant Martyrs of Chriſt, Cranmer Ridley, and Latimer, and others to diſpute at Oxford, with the moſt vnreaſonable ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie that might be, yet thei ſo receiued and put out all the fierie dartes of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and his inſtrumentes caſt againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſo foiled and wounded their enemies, that bothe all that were preſent, whoſe eyes the Lorde had vouchſafed to open to ſee the truthe, and whoſoeuer ſhall yet reade it to this daie, maie eaſily ſee that the ſheilde of faithe was their defence, &amp; that thei fought valiauntly with the ſworde of the ſpirite, to the confuſion of thoſe that ſtroue againſte theim. And though their bodies were vſed afterward at the pleaſure of their aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, hauyng no regard of their callyng, no reuerence of their learnyng, no reſpecte of
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:19102:159"/> their age, yet after the example of Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the true Samſon Chriſt Ieſus, by death thei obtained victorie againſt theim.</p>
            <p>In the beginnyng of the happie raigne of her Maieſtie, now ſittyng in the Royall ſeate of her Fathers, their Biſhoppes and greateſt Clerkes were prouoked, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poincted by aucthoritie to diſpute, if thei were able to maintain their doctrine, with ſuche miniſters of the Goſpell as were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to deale with them in it. Which action as it appeareth by the ſtorie, and teſtimonie of many that were preſent at it, was ſo fo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ridiculouſly handled on the parte of the greateſt Pillers of their pretended Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Churche, that al men maruell that the memorie of the confuſion and ſhame of that daie, doeth not with hold them once to moue the matter of diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with vs. For after a little impertinent ſpeeche, thei gaue ouer their cauſe in the plain field. But thei ſaie, he that runneth awaie maie fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and ſo peraduenture theſe men haue now gotten more harte of grace, then thei had before, or els theſe Romiſtes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtes thinke peraduenture their Biſhops were vnlearned, but that thei in ſo many yeres trauell and ſtudy abroad, haue better
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:19102:160"/> furniſhed theim ſelues for the battaill. But their weakeneſſe was notably diſcouered, in their greate Champion and Father Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite, who offeryng defiaunce with Goliah to the hoſte of Iſraell, as if the ſtaffe of his Speare had been as a Weauers beame, he was bolde to caſte vs his Gloue, and throw vs his Gauntlet, to prouoke vs to fight with hym, boaſtyng to maintaine his cauſe by Scripture, Councells, Fathers, by all Lawes, Common, Ciuill, and Canon, and all Stories. A man would thinke ſuche a Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pion had been able to haue doen great matters, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was after encountred with, his glorie was tourned to ſhame, and the Diuinitie he boaſted of, was founde to bee but certaine of the boldeſt and moſte vnreaſonable aſſeuerations of the fondeſt and moſte abſurde diſtinctions that euer were heard of, wherby he ſuppoſed to haue been well armed againſte all obiections. For a taſte whereof I offer the gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome fewe, whiche I heard beeyng pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the diſputation. In the matters of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of faithe onely, whereas he had falſly and ſlanderouſly charged vs of late to haue brought into the Church this new doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of iuſtification by faith onely, and that
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:19102:160"/> there were places cited out of the Fathers Greeke and Latin, who liued aboue <hi>1000.</hi> yeares agoe, expreſly hauyng theſe words, that faithe onely iuſtifieth: He aunſwered that it was to bee vnderſtoode of the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wherein hauyng confeſſed a truthe (for ſo the Apoſtle ſaieth that God iuſtifieth the vngodly by faithe: that is, holdeth hym god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Chriſt in whom he beleeueth, who in himſelf is vngodly) by ſuggeſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, he fought againe to ouerthrowe that he had ſaied by a fond diſtinction of two iuſtifications, a thyng meerely deuiſed in the braine of man. For who euer read in the Scriptures that a man is iuſtified before God any more then once: but that thei who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> GOD had once reputed for iuſt he holdeth them ſo for euer. Otherwiſe the reaſon of the Apoſtles iuſtification by faithe were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng, if the Iewes might haue aunſwered thus, that when he was firſt conuerted from Idolatrie: Abraham was in deede iuſtified by faithe onely, but after he was circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and had offered vp his ſonne, he was iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified againe, and that was by his workes, but this was a fancy not once dreamed of by them. Therefore the Apoſtle taketh it for a grounde, that beyng once iuſtified by faith
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:19102:161"/> onely he was alwaies iuſtified before God by faithe alone. An other folly of a ſuche like diſtinction was ioyned with this, that onely in the Fathers alleadged, ſhatteth out onely the workes goyng before his faith, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he forgat that he ouerthrewe their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of congruitie, whiche thei pretende to confirme out of Cornelius exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple) but not the grace giuen together with faith, whiche is hope and charitie: whiche aunſwere is as flat contrarie to the doctrine of the Apoſtle as darkeneſſe is to light. For if Abraham were iuſtified by faithe hope and charitie, then was he not iuſtified without the woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of the lawe, for hope and charitie are workes of the lawe. It is contrarie alſo to their owne doctrine: for if the firſt iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be by faithe hope and charitie, what ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond iuſtification can there be, or what other thyng will thei require beſides faithe hope and charitie, to iuſtifie with a ſeconde iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. This ſeconde iuſtification he would haue confirmed by the helpe of their vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare Latine tranſlation, whiche hath, <hi>Qui iuſtus eſt iuſtificetur adhuc,</hi> but very corruptly: for the Greeke is, he that doeth iuſtice let him doe iuſtice ſtil: as if he ſhould ſaie, he that doth well let hym doe well ſtill,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:19102:161"/> and he that doeth ill lett hym doe ill ſtill, whiche is as farre from the queſtion of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification as the Eaſt is from the Weſt. In the queſtion of tranſubſtanciation to the place of Ireneus, that there is a ſpirituall thyng in the Sacrament and alſo a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, whiche he expreſly ſpeaketh of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubſtaunce of bread: His aunſwere was, that the materiall thing was the accidentes that appeared, the whiteneſſe, lightneſſe, roundneſſe, &amp;c. To Oregen affirmyng that whiche is receiued at the mouthe to goe to the ſtomacke and to nouriſhe the bodie, and to bee caſt into the draught: His aunſwere was that the accidentes doe nouriſhe, and that the accidentes are voyded. Contrary to all lawe and order of nature whiche God hath appointed. For it is no more poſſible y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> accidents being not in any ſubſtance ſhould nouriſhe, as it is that darkeneſſe ſhould at the ſame tyme bee bothe darkeneſſe and light. To Theodor affirmyng the nature and ſubſtaunce of the bread to remaine: He aunſwered that Theodor vnderſtoode it of the ſubſtaunce of the accidentes, and a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſubſtaunce, whereby an accident hath a beyng, and not of the ſpeciall ſubſtaunce of bread, whereas it is as cleare as the daie at
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:19102:162"/> noone: that Theodor meant plainly that the very ſubſtaunce of the bread remaineth ſtill in the ſpeciall ſubſtaunce of breade, and is not altered otherwiſe then in the vſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it is applied: that is, that beyng naturally appoincted of GOD for the feedyng of the bodie, it hath hereby the inſtitution of that Sacrament a heauenly vſe, whiche is to feede our ſoules. A nomber of theſe fonde and vnreaſonable, abſurde, and vnlearned diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of his I could alledge, but thei are now at large reported, and publiſhed to the world, and theſe may ſerue for a taſte of the abilitie of theſe men, who would make the worlde beleeue, thei come now ſo furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to the battaile, that if wee would meete them but once in the field, the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie were their owne. Yet I remember whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one of theim alledged a place out of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians, there was ſent to this Champion a Greke Teſtament, who aſhamed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe his ignoraunce, excuſed himſelf by the ſmalneſſe of the print. From whom beyng caried to the reſt of them, &amp; ſo from one to an other, al their chief men being there, not a man emongeſt them could be found, that durſte take vpon hym, to render one poore ſentence or twoo out of the Greeke Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:19102:162"/> into Engliſhe. Are not theſe bolde Champions to boaſte ſo muche of learning to enter into a Countrie to conuerte them to the faithe, to take vpon them to controll all our tranſlations of the holie Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res as erronious and falſe, and not one of ſo many of theim, to vnderſtande the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall tongues Hebrewe and Greke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thei were firſte written by the holie men of God, by whom thei were lefte vnto vs. How ſhould thei bee able to diſproue our tranſlations, who them ſelues can not tell what is rightly tranſlated, and what is not: as hauyng no ſkill in the learned tongues out of the whiche thei are tranſlated. Are not theſe famous Clearkes greatly to bee feared in diſputation, that can not vouche their aucthors in the tongues wherein thei wrote. Thei haue now founde a helpe for this, Gregorie Martine hath knowledge i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for them all, and the vulgare Latine is authenticall, ſo made by the Councell of Trent, that is by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power wherby thei may doe all thynges. Theſe helpes I doubt not but thei ſhal ſhortly ſe to be ſo poore ſhiftes, as thei were beſt not let al lie vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Martins ſkill, leaſt thei marre all, but bryng vp o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the knowledge of the tongues,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:19102:163"/> who maie begin to learne theim ſoner then Martin did: and to finde ſome better ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour to ſhroud the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vnder, then the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentike authoritie of their vulgare Latine text, for this wil not ſerue them, as I doubt not but thei ſhall vnderſtand ere it be long.</p>
            <p>But to retourne againe to this renewer of the challenge of diſputation, their cauſe beyng ſo ſlender, as all the tongues of men and Aungelles are not able to make good, and yet the Captaines of this their newe and late inuaſion, ſo vnfurniſhed of theſe meanes: what reaſon can he haue thus to vaunt, that we dare not admitte any triall, or what cauſe hath he thus to boaſte, if he will conſider that whiche I haue truely for this purpoſe afore, reported of their Champion, God beeyng witneſſe and of myne owne knowledge. He would faine excuſe this ſhamefull vanitie of an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt and vnſkilfull man, in the matter he preſumed to take vpon hym: by ſaiyng he had been racked, or il handled before, he had no warnyng to forethinke hym ſelf, he was allowed no bookes, nor equall Notaries, nor ſuffered to oppoſe, but aſſaulted with greate wordes, ſterne countenaunce, bigge voice, and vnciuill reuilyng. For his Rac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:19102:163"/> was ſuche, as he was able after it to come and go of himſelf without any helpe. For warnyng me thinke he ſhould not gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly neede muche warnyng, that made ſo proude a chalenge. Goliah yet was wiſer then ſo, for he had about hym and with hym his weapons wherein he truſted, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not any warnyng, but was readie and appoincted in all partes to maintaine his chalenge. Yet this I can ſaie, that he had ſometymes as muche warnyng as thei whiche diſputed with hym, and this equitie vſed towardes hym, that he hym ſelf na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med one of the queſtions to bee diſputed, as the opponentes did the other. He was offered to haue what bookes he would, and deſiryng none but <hi>Caniſius</hi> Catechiſme, had it prouided for hym. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any writing was, there was no anſwere of his ſet doune but allowed of hym, after that he had been demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, whether that were his anſwere or no. To oppoſe was not for hym that had choſen his place to ſtand as at the barriers, to aunſwere all commers. For woordes he would take none at any mannes hande, ſo farre was he vnlike to hym that ſaied, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as a dumbe man: and againe as the lambe before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhearer, ſo opened he not his
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:19102:164"/> mouth. And yet me thinke a greate worde or ſterne countenaunce, ſhould not haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſed hym, if he had ſeen hym that is inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. The Prophet Ieremie had a face gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen hym like the Adamant, that could not be daunted, he was as a Lion, whoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce the beaſtes of the Foreſts are not able to looke vpon. If he had come of the ſame meſſage, the Lorde would haue forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his harte with a ſpirite of power, that wordes and countenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces ſhould not haue daunted hym. Therefore, how ſoeuer he would excuſe the matter, thei whiche were witneſſes of the dealyng with their chiefe Champion, muſt needes in all indifference thinke, if theſe men vpon euery challenge or offer bee not diſputed with, that there is ſome other reaſon in it, then either the fear of any abilitie that is in theim, or any wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneſſe that is in vs. For it is the lorde that ſtrengtheneth the weake, that ſheweth his power in infirmitie, and calleth thynges that are not as if thei were. On the other part it is he that throweth doune y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mightie from their ſeates, that maketh warre with the proude, that breaketh the talleſt Ships of the ſeas, and felleth doune the mightieſt Cedre in Libane, and higheſt Okes in the
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:19102:164"/> Forreſtes. It is he that ſaueth by fewe as well as by many, by thoſe whom his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies diſpiſe, as well as by meanes that might make them to tremble. And ſeeyng as Abia ſaied to Ieroboam and all Iſraell, that it is thei whiche haue made theim Prieſtes not of the tribe of Leui, or of the Soonnes of Aaron, but of the baſeſt of the people, that is not by any lawfull callyng, but contrary to the worde of God, and prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes not to GOD but to Idolles, whiche haue put out the light of the golden Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticke, in withholdyng the knowledge of the woorde, that haue taken awaie the ſweete breade loaues from the preſence ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſet leauened bread on for it, takyng awaie the ſinceritie and truthe of incorrupt doctrine &amp; life, and bringyng in the leauen of the Phariſeis, naie thei that haue ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Churche of God, of the moſte preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cupp of the blood of the newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that haue made voide the Croſſe of Chriſte by their merites, and profaned all that was holie in the Sanctuarie of the Lorde: how ſhould we feare how weake ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer we ſeem to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or be in deede to deale with them? For ſeeing by the grace of God we haue been vouchſafed the fauour, to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:19102:165"/> again the Lampe in the Temple of the Lorde, to ſet the ſweete bread vpon his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to reſtore the bleſſed Cuppe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood of Chriſt to the Church again: Finally, to caſte out the filthe and polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherewith thei had defiled the Lordes Temple, and to reforme it, ſo as the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue and auncient beautie and holineſſe of it, maie ſhine and appeare in it again: How ſhould wee fall before them in the battaile, or feare the daie of encountryng with them in diſputation? The Lord goeth out before our armies, his holie Arke dwelleth emon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt vs, his ſiluer Trumpets ſound conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in our eares. Which are ſure &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted arguments, that as heretofore we haue often preuailed againſt them, ſo now muche more that our enemie ſo oftentimes foiled bee he neuer ſo obſtinate, yet can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be able to hurte vs: or if he doe, it ſhalbe onely thus, accordyng to the promiſe, he maie bruſe our heele, but we ſhall burſt his head in péeces. Thus much for his firſt way sf diſputation, wherein I haue ſhewed that oftentymes by conference in ſpeeche, thei haue fled before vs. Concerning diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by writyng, al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world is full of the learned workes of our worthy fathers and brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:19102:165"/> wherein thei haue bothe taught the truthe, and worthely maintained it againſte the wicked flaunders and obiection of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie, and conuicted theim of as notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and pernicious hereſies, as euer haue been ſince the miſterie of Iniquitie began to woorke. What ſhould I recken vp here whiche are infinite, the names (whiche are written in the booke of life) of our moſte worthie fathers and brethren, who beyonde the Seas haue aunſwered all their Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengers, confuted their erronious and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall writynges, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed the truth to abide for euer. Our owne countriemen haue in like ſort maintained y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords moſt iuſte and honourable quarrell, againſte all ſuche as from emongeſt our ſelues haue beene raiſed vp to blaſpheme the truthe.

Wherefore, hauyng thus been fought with at all the weapons wherein they ſuppoſed they had any ſkill, and their ſhieldes beaten to their heades ſo often and pearced through, what a wrangling conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and obſtinate Aduerſarie is this, that will yet renewe more chalenges, and boaſt that we dare: <hi>Neither abroade with neuer ſo muche ſecuritie, nor at home vppon our owne grounde ſhewe our ſelues in diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt them?</hi> Whether would they haue vs to goe, to Roome, or to Rhemes, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute with them there?

But if thei would haue their bookes to pas fréely without reſtraint, and all men to be allowed to reade them: let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> firſt aſſure vs, that thei will leaue it free for all ſuche as are abuſed by them to reade ours. For we are not ignorant of their diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, though moſt diſſolute where it ſhould be ſtraiteſt: yet herein applied to the keping of the poore and ignorant which depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, in that captiuitie, that thei maie not once dare to reade our writynges, leaſt thei ſhould be conuerted and repent that the Lorde might ſaue them.

But if this diſcipline remainyng on bothe parties, thei bee yet diſpoſed to diſpute to informe them ſelues in the truth: if thei wil leaue this large maner of diſcourſing, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taunts, and other impertinent ſpeeches not ſo fitt for tryall of a truthe, and come to the ſharpe poinctes of naked argumentes, we are willyng to deale with them in ſuche order as maie be moſt indifferent for bothe, and fitteſt for the information in truthe of all ſuche as ſhall after examine what hath paſt on bothe partes. For whiche purpoſe, it would be fitteſt that in euery queſtion the contradictorie beyng taken, the one parte for that whiche he holdeth in the queſtion laied out his argumentes, taken onely out of the holy Scriptures (whiche is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly competent Iudge in this cauſe) conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in good forme of Syllogiſme, without any further deduction of the matter, then ſhould be neceſſarie for the better vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the termes which needes muſt be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, &amp; of the application of the places whiche ſhall be alleadged. Herevnto maie be added,

Which beyng doen by either partie, then that either of them bothe aunſwere the argumentes of the other, and ſtrengthen again his owne in ſuche place as the aduerſe partie ſhall thinke to be weake. Which paſſyng thus to and fro till bothe haue ſaid what thei are able for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, will leaue ſuche a meanes for thoſe whiche are willing to informe their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the truthe, as by gods grace it wil be eaſie to diſcerne. His ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d reaſon, wherby it maie appeare, that their ſtandyng in this cauſe is not without ſubſtanciall warrant, is noted to be the vncertaintie of temporall fauor in matters of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but that ſectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherevpon it is noted, conteineth no ſuche matter, but onely this, that it is not inough to perſwade them, that we ſaie we haue the Goſpell, becauſe other alſo condemne vs,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:19102:168" rendition="simple:additions"/> and ſaie thei haue it: we are not ignoraunte that euery one maketh claime to haue the Goſpell, and condemne thoſe whiche ioyne not with them. Amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt whom that he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth Luther, and a Scholer of his, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre him to my anſwere, where this is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged of hym before, which anſwere maie ſerue for his Scholer too. As for the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitaries and Anabaptiſtes, it is but his his malice and hatred againſt the Goſpell, to recken vs with theim, whom wee are as vnlike in all their vngodly opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as thei are vnlike the true Churche of Chriſt, and her moſte holy faith. But this were an aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, if we had nothing but the bare word and boaſtyng of the Goſpell. Wee haue made, God be praiſed for it, ſufficient profe to all equall Iudges, that it is bothe in woorde and in deede, the true Goſpell and pure woorde of GOD, and the lawe of the lorde, whiche is now the Religion through the goodneſſe, whiche hath viſited vs from aboue, eſtabliſhed and preached emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt vs.</p>
            <p>The twoo next ſections haue ſome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in them like this title: for in the firſte of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he affirmeth the holie Religion, whiche is now eſtabliſhed, to haue been brought in by an noble man after king Henries daies
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:19102:169"/> whiche he ſaieth could doe moſte, by bryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng in twoo Caluiniſtes, as he tearmeth them, to read in the two Vniuerſities here. Whiche he ſo laieth out, as if we had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtaie for Religion, but that noble man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes pleaſure, who he ſaith, if he would haue brought in twoo of any other ſecte, might aſwell haue eſtabliſhed it: whervpon he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, that ſeyng that ſeculer magiſtrate nor temporall law is no ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ground in religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there is no cauſe but thei ſhould be excuſed, to continue ſtil in their opinion as thei doe. And thus he retourneth againe to his requeſt of diſputation. But firſt for this his ſecond reaſon. He maie remember hym ſelf, that their Dagon was fallen to the grounde, though not with ſo greate hurte as after, euen in the tyme and raigne of Kyng Henry the eight of noble memorie. So that to ſpeake in any reaſon, he cannot laie the foundation of the Goſpell now e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt vs, vpon the onely meanes of the noble manne, whom he noteth. He might haue remembred that worthie thinges wer doen in K. H. tyme. For God had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that noble king, beſides his owne abilitie, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcouer the ambitious pride, and greedie co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe of the Clergie, the repugnance
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:19102:169"/> of the Popes ſupremacie, with the ſoueran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his roiall croune and dignitie, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations of the Diſpenſations of the Pope, and ſondrie ſuche like weightie and materiall poinctes of true Religion. For, GOD gaue vnto hym by ſides ſome other meanes, chiefe furtheraunce to the ſight of theſe thynges, by that moſte vertuous and excellent Princes Ladie Anne Bulleyne, the moſte honourable mother of our dreade Soueraine Ladie, now raignyng ouer vs: whoſe eyes God hauyng opened to ſee the truthe, her religious and zealous mynde, louyng the wiſedome that is greater then Salomon, whiche the famous Queene of Saba was ſo delighted with, and beeyng carefull for Gods people, as Queene He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, was a worthy meanes, to draw y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noble kyng to better iudgement and knowledge in Religion, then he had been of before: whiche was alſo Godlie continued by the good and gracious Ladie Queene Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine Par. Further alſo beſides many other he had two as wiſe &amp; faithfull cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſailors as euer had Chriſtian kyng before hym. The one that reuerend and learned father Cra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and the other the wiſe lord Cromwel, counſellours worthie of eternall memorie,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:19102:170"/> for their Religious ſtout and wiſe dealyng againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miſterie of iniquitie. For hauing not to do onely with the Popes Conſiſtory and Veſtrie, with his Cannon lawe &amp; beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly wardrope, with his diſcipline &amp; cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies: but with his whole bodie, with his whole houſe and te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo rooted and grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, as if the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dations of it had been layd in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> centre of the earth: yet God pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſuche a Chriſtian magnanimitie into their noble hartes to vndertake, and ſuch a ſound iudgement to deuiſe the way, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the ouerthrowe of it, and to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thoſe deepe foundations, as if the lord had giuen theim a pouder to rende vp thoſe ſtately houſes, as Bulwerkes of Sathan, and Caſtles of ſuperſtition and Idolatrie, which ſeemed to haue been builded to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to the ende of the worlde. Further the Goſpell was taught bothe in other places, and alſo here in Englande, and was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, beleued, and profeſſed moſt conſtantly to the death, by ſondrie true profeſſors of it, and conſtaunt martyrs of Chriſte, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that tyme he ſpeaketh of. Wherefore, there is no reaſon to make the entrance of thoſe two readers, the beginning of true re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vs. Moreouer, alſo in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginnyng
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:19102:170"/> of the raigne of that noble &amp; princely king Edward: Who knoweth not that the ſtate of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was eſtabliſhed within this land by act of Parlament, before the commyng in of thoſe readers into the vniuerſitees: ſo that this reaſon is vtterly voide of all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginnyng of religion emongſt vs, who came in twoo yeres after it had been throughly and quietly eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, as it is at this preſent daie. After in deede by the worthie meanes of the noble Duke of Sommerſett Lorde Protector and the right reuerend Cranmer, twoo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous clearkes that then were of the moſte renoumed, for their vertue and learnyng in all theſe partes of Europe, Martin Bucer and Peter Martyr wer procured ouer, and placed the one in Cambridge, the other in Oxford, to the greate ſeruice of almightie God, and of this his Churche. For, thei ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng to the Apoſtles exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ouer a forme of ſound doctrine to many worthy ſcholers, whiche receiued it of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and deliuered it ouer againe to others. In a happie tyme came thei ouer to our Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities, to turne them, which had been in tyme paſt as heathes &amp; dry groundes, voide of the true knowledge of God, into ſprings
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:19102:171"/> of water, whoſe brookes might iſſue forth to the refreſhyng and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of all the land, their deſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and liyng waſt as Sodom and Gomorrha, thei tourned through the grace of GOD into a fruitfull place, like mount Carmell and the garden of Eden, full of good fruite and medicinable to the ſoules of men. Therefore, bleſſed bee their noble memorie whoſoeuer thei were that brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer. But to ſaie that Religion ſtoode then in ſuch termes here in England, that if thoſe two had been Anabaptiſtes our religion this day in England had been ſuch, and thei ſhould aſwel haue béen puniſhed for not receiuing it, as thei are for refuſing that is now eſtabliſhed, is a malicious ſlaunder of a hatefull harte to the Goſpell of Chriſte and the profeſſors of the ſame: ſeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> before their comming in as hath been declared, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was fully ſetled and eſtabliſhed here as it continueth to this daie. As for that he calleth them Caluiniſtes, to paſſe by that for age, Caluin might rather haue been na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of them then thei of hym: He is to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande wee haue no ſuche cuſtome, nor the Churche of God to name our ſelues of any men. Chriſt is not deuided with vs, we all content our ſelues with that honourable
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:19102:171"/> name of Chriſtians. To be a Franciſcane, or a Dominicane, a Thomiſt, or a Scotiſt we leaue to them, who haue deuided &amp; rent aſunder both Chriſtes coate and bodie. We knowe by the grace of God how to reſpect the giftes of God in his holy Organes and Inſtrumentes of his glorie, without dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatyng from God his honor to giue it to an other. Thus it appeareth that Religion with vs had his beginnyng of the worde of God knowne to many, and profeſſed to the deathe by ſondrie of this Nation afore the lawe, whereby it was eſtabliſhed. Wherby it is manifeſt that Religion was not grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the Temporall lawe and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates authoritie, but that the godly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and the wiſe men of all the lande aſſembled together in the high Courte of Parliament, hauyng vnderſtoode before by the worde of God, and many expreſſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies bothe here at home and els where abroade, whereby God gaue witneſſe vnto it, that the Religion which of auncient tyme had been taught in this lande, (though for a tyme it had beene eclipſed and darckened, and then beganne euery where through the power of GOD to bee renewed againe,) that that I ſaie was in deede the holy word
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:19102:172"/> and ſeruice of God, and the true doctrine of the Prophetes and Apoſtles, thei agreed withall obedience vnto God ſo to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it, and as Aſa and Darius (though not with any thing like ſeueritie of puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) commaunded it to bee receiued and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by all the Subiectes of this ſtate and Kyngdome. We depend not therfore vpon a Temporall lawe for matter of Religion, but bothe the lawe and we vpon the eternall lawe and word of God, but this iniury muſt be doen to the hye ſtate of this noble lande, that theſe men maie be admitted to diſpute. Therefore, here he falleth in againe to the mention of a diſputation, and reneweth the petition of his fellowes, <hi>for it promiſyng largely, that if ſuche indifferent triall maie bee graunted betweene the learned of bothe ſides, as thei demaunde for their instruction &amp; due reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in iudgement, if thei erre the matter perhappes maie ſone bee ended.</hi>

Whereby it appereth that the Apoſtle ſheweth, that as a buildyng is not ſeen, while the worke is vnder ground, but onely whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſheweth aboue the ground, ſo likewiſe there was a tyme when this Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagog of Sathan was in building, but the ſtones of the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation of it beyng laied ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

Our ſauiour Chriſte giueth warnyng, that there ſhould come that falſly would chalenge the name of Chriſt and his Apoſtles vnto them, who ſhould bee able by their liyng Signes and wonders, to deceiue if it wer poſſible, euen the elect. In the Parable of tares he ſaith, that the houſebandman beyng a ſleepe, the enemie came &amp; ſowed Tares in the night. Which notwithſtandyng that no man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the night, nor could tell who had doen it, yet when the ſpring came forward, ſure thei wer that was not of the good ſéede that was ſowne in the field by their maiſter but Tares: therfore though thei could not diſcerne it, nor knewe not any enemy y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had entred into the field to ſow Tares in it, yet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei were ſprong vp thei knew the Ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res to be Tares, &amp; becauſe their Maiſters ſéede y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was ſowne was good, the ſeruantes are aſſured y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the enemie which is ſatan had ſowne them, though thei knew not by what hand and inſtrument, nor at what hower of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> night he ſowed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Euen ſo in this caſe, while men feared no ſuche daunger, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie ſowed theſe Hereſies in the church, which for a time after were not to be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:19102:174"/> till this euill ſeede was growne, and came to ſhew it ſelf vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ground, which beyng now ſprong vp, can we not bee ſure that Tares are Tares, and hereſies be he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, except we be able to tel who &amp; when did ſowe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? It is inough for vs to knowe that our Maiſters ſeede is perfect &amp; good, whatſoeuer els commeth vp with it, that is not of the ſeede, we are ſure it is a ſtinkyng weede, or a vile graine, ſitter for beaſtes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for men: and not the fine wheate, the fruite of the precious ſeede of our Maiſter. This doctrine of our Sauiour Chriſt was this precious ſeede, as he expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth it. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>euer therefore groweth vp with it, though for a ſeaſon it can not bee diſcouered, yet if after it diſcouereth it ſelf not to bee agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſounde and wholſome doctrine of Chriſte, but a wicked hereſie, and the curſed fruite of a naughtie ſeede, though wee can neither tell by whom, nor at what tyme the Enemie did ſowe it, yet ſure wee are it is hereticall, and hath beene ſowne ſince the tyme that our Maiſter ſowed his fielde with good Seede. Therefore, his reaſon can not proue the iſſue to bee reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. Muche leſſe doeth his experience. His ſecond profe herein, which is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:19102:175"/> as the reaſon before of ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> errors, which ſhew themſelues at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt, manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the holy doctrine of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church. As for his examples, by hudlyng vp toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, Puritane, and Family, as if thei wer all alike, it is but the heate of his cholerike ſtomacke.<note place="margin">By expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</note> For all the worlde knoweth how farr the true profeſſors of the Goſpell, are fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> execrable hereſies of the Family, which ſpro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vp in the time of their deteinyng of the worlde in captiuitie, &amp; yet whiche of them euer once rebuked or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled it by word or writyng: but now the light hath diſcouered it, ſhal y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> light be ſaid to haue brought it forth, or ſhall it not now be rebuked, becauſe none of the pretended Catholikes, haue rebuked it, let theim bee their Iudges. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the Puritane, if he meane ſuche as thinke themſelues pure and frée from ſinne, thei are al one with the Family, and farre more like the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who boaſt of their own iuſtice, then thei are to vs who deny our own righteouſneſſe, that we maie haue the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, which is by faith. If he meane ſuch as deſire to haue the ſtate of the church, yet fréer fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders and confuſions, &amp; more nerely refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the ordenance of our ſauiour Chriſt,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:19102:175"/> and the example of the Apoſtles, and other Churches ſo reformed in many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, profeſſyng the ſame Goſpell with vs: Then I think euery good Proteſtant and Profeſſour is a Puritane, and few that are otherwiſe minded, except it be ſuch, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the corruptions they haue left behinde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and we haue not yet caſt out after them be glorious and gainful. But for the purpoſe, thei are here alledged, theſe exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples make nothing for him. If thei reproued vs, it was not becauſe thei were able iuſtly to charge vs, but becauſe wee diſcouered their ſhame to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde, becauſe we detected their here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies againſt God and their conſpiracies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Princes and people. If any profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour of the Goſpell haue reproued the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliſt, as thei in deede haue beene confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by vs, when theſe men neglected the matter, he might eaſely doe it, the Goſpell clerely diſcoueryng the error, &amp; his reward is with GOD. And if any for ſeekyng a further reformation by orderly meanes haue been reproued, the reprouer, &amp; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued haue both their iudge, who will giue to euery one according to his deedes. Thus then it appeareth to bee no reaſonable iſſue which thei offer, that except we can tell the
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:19102:176"/> tymes and Authors of their ſondrie hereſies that we ſhould acknowledge them of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. It is enough for vs that we know hereſie to bee hereſie, and that by the worde of God. And if thei will ioyne a reaſonable iſſue with vs, we offer them one farre more reaſonable the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this: Let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhew out of the authenticke writynges of Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles the poinctes thei varie from vs in (as wee vndertake and by Gods grace are able to performe of ours) that thei are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and left in them. Theſe writynges are perfect, exact and incorrupt? What doe thei ſeeke vncertaine Hyſtories, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde for recordes not to be had or found, and refuſe theſe the onely ſufficient and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall. He boaſteth a Goliahes boaſte to ſhewe all the poinctes wherein wee differ from them, their Parentes, their Cradle, the calculation of the tyme of their Birthe. Which I maruell not at, for our Sauiour Chriſte and his Apoſtles are Authours of them, thei were laied with hym in his Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and publiſhed in his tyme by hym ſelf, and then after by his Apoſtles. So that as of an noble childe borne of knowne and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Parentes, it is no harde matter to poinct out bothe the Parentes and tyme of
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:19102:176"/> the natiuitie of it: But as of a baſe ſonne of a common Harlott no man can tell the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: So their Romiſhe Superſtition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng the baſe iſſue of the whore of Bablilon: no maruell though wee can not tell who it was that begot it. That Harlot hath had ſo many louers, as it is not eaſie for her ſelfe to tell who was father of her ſondrie Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards: But though neither their father nor tyme of birthe be knowne, is it therefore to bee concluded that thei are right and noble borne? nothyng leſſe: But any other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes and Authours of our faithe then our Sauiour Chriſt and his Apoſtles, neither he nor all the ſonnes of <hi>Romulus</hi> at <hi>Roome,</hi> nor of <hi>Remus</hi> at <hi>Rhemes,</hi> ſhall euer bee able to ſhewe. Thei maie eaſily ſhewe by whoſe bleſſed miniſterie the Lorde of late hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored vnto vs this Goſpell again, as it was eaſie in <hi>Ioſias</hi> tyme to ſaie that the booke of the lawe was founde in <hi>Ioſias</hi> tyme the <hi>13.</hi> yeare of his reigne by <hi>Hilcia</hi> the Prieſt: whiche was no preiudice to the lawe. For if it had not been founde till of late when the Goſpell (accordyng to the truthe of it) was found: yet had it been neuertheleſſe the law of God, and that moſt holy and auncient law whiche had been giuen ſometymes by the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:19102:177"/> miniſterie of <hi>Moſes.</hi> So likewiſe thei may name in what Kynges daies, what yeare of his reigne Luther began to diſcouer the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination of the Popes indulgences, &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter both he and others reſtored to vs againe after a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g apoſtaſie &amp; time of darkneſſe the knowledge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth: yet were thei no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of it, no more then <hi>Helcia</hi> of the law, but <hi>Moſes</hi> of the law, and Chriſt of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell whiche thei preached, and other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors ſhall thei neuer be able to ſhewe. But for their Romiſhe faithe we will ioyne this iſſue with them to ſhewe it is not of Chriſt nor of his Apoſtles. Further alſo notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandyng that thei and others who haue ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the worlde haue waſted all the recordes of many auncient Writers, that we can not haue the writynges of all that did controlle them: and that in ſome fewe <hi>100.</hi> yeares in the beginnyng, their faithe crept in by little and little by ſoft and flowe paces, and that with greate hypocriſie that it could not bee well diſcouered, and therfore not eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled for ſuche tyme: yet will wee ſhewe that when the buildyng and ſeede appeared aboue the grounde, the ſeruauntes of God diſcouered Antichriſtes Sinagoge and his Tares, and haue freely complained to the
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:19102:177"/> Lorde againſt it. The reaſon why it is hard to diſcouer the Authors and tymes of the ſeuerall pointes of this Popiſhe hereſie are theſe. Firſt, it entered not into the Churche all at once, but in ſondry ages declined from the truthe of the Goſpell, till it came to this full apoſtaſie, wherein it hath beene now ſome hundred yeres. The degrees of which declination were ſo ſmall at the beginnyng that thei were not eaſily to be ſpied.<note place="margin">Reaſons why this iſſue is not to be ioyned.</note> For as the graſſe and wheate growe as wee reade in the Goſpell, yet no man can diſcerne the growyng of it or ſee how muche of it ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vp in a daie: So likewiſe doe the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. A man maie well diſcerne them when thei are growne, but while thei are growing it is not eaſie to diſcerne. Secondly, the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall ſhewe that theſe beginnynges of declination caried with them was a greate meanes to deceiue the worlde. For if it bee not eaſie to know the Wolfe in a Sheepes ſkinne, nor the Beaſt in his ſhewe of two hornes like a Lambe, nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angell of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe when he tranſformeth hymſelf like to an Aungell of light: ſo moſt of all this hath place in little and ſmall beginninges of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, couered and clothed with a ſhewe of good deuotion. For theſe and ſuche like
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:19102:178"/> cauſes, the auncient Fathers within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt <hi>4.</hi> or <hi>500.</hi> yeares, tooke no greate heede to the little and ſmall beginnynges, that were then laied of this miſterie of iniquitie. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo, thoſe tymes were exerciſed grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly in ſtriuing with maine Heretickes, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng to ouerturne openly the groundes and foundations of our faithe, concernyng the twoo natures and vnitie of the perſone of Chriſt Ieſu. Thei had to ſtriue w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ebion Cerinthus, Arius, Eutiches, Eunomius Neſtorius, and after with the Donaſties, Pelagians, and many other, who eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and manifeſtly ſought the ſubuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the chiefe groundes of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Wherfore, hauyng to deale with many open enemies, and of thoſe ſome of greate abilitie to hurt the churche, for ſpeciall gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of knoledge and eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, thei ſet them ſelues as there was great cauſe thei ſhould to reſiſt the forcible violence of thoſe migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie enemies: whereby it was ſcarſe poſſible for thoſe worthie &amp; learned fathers to take heede to thoſe degrees of ſuperſtition, that by little and little ſo ſuttely and hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally crept into the church. Beſides this, if any of them did diſcerne the ſoft ſlidyng a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie from true religion and deuotion into
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:19102:178"/> ſuperſtition, yet ſure thei neuer feared the iſſue would haue been ſuche as experience hath taught vs. And if thei gaue any token of their diſlike hereof the waſtes and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the world ſince that time haue been ſuche, as it maie be well enough, that ſome of them reproued more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can now be ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed by any workes that are extant. There were many worthie and famous me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which wrote infinite volumes, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now little remaineth, and ſome nothyng but their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes. Origen wrote exceedyng muche, yet there remaineth now little in compariſon of that he wrote, and that which remaineth is ſo corrupted, that it nothing aunſwereth the famous reporte of learnyng, which O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen had in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church in his tyme. To this maie be added that the B. of R. by meanes of the R. Emperors whiche were Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the worlde, with whom thei were in credit, had the meanes to deface &amp; aboliſhe all writynges, rolles, and recordes, whiche might hinder the growyng of their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions. And that this is no vaine ſurmiſe of a thyng that might bee, it appeareth that thei were ſo diligent to doe it as ther was nothyng ſo authentike and reuerende that for their purpoſe thei were not ready to cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:19102:179"/> and falſifie. What was more reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in Auſtens tyme then the famous councell of Nice, and the Cannons agreed of by the Fathers, aſſembled together in that reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Conſiſtory &amp; Senate: yet the B. of R. corrupted &amp; falſified the <hi>9.</hi> Cannon of that Councell, to lay the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dations of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, whiche thei pretended vnto ouer all Churches. For ſo the Story reporteth that Fauſtine the B. of R. Legate or Deputie alledged that Cannon for the Supremacy, which being after diligently ſought for by Auſten &amp; the reſt of the Fathers, was found to bee corrupted, and ſo thei wrote vnto the B. whiche foule act to corrupt the Canno<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of ſo reuerende a Councell, and to ſeeke to abuſe therby the cheefeſt and worthieſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes of God in thoſe daies and beſt able to diſcouer his falſhoode, doeth euidently ſhew that in other writynges which ſhould neuer come to like examination and tryall they would make ſmall conſcience of like corruptions ſo thei might ſerue their tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Further, the creditte they obtained in the Church by ſome good Biſhoppes of Roome in the beginning and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirs of Chriſt, was a great meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by theſe whiche ſucceeded in their places,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:19102:179"/> but not in their pietie and holye profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion togeather with the power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie which they had gotten of the Emperours, coulde not ſo eaſily and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly bee diſcouered, as that the tyme of their beginning to fall awaie, and theire ſecrete procéeding and growing forwarde ſhoulde bee openly controlled. Which we may ſee in the declinations and conuerſions of common welths. For the lawfull gouernement of Kinges or of a ſenate of Princes, or of the ſtates of a land, after an equall and iuſt regiment of ſome yeares, either of purpoſe, or tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the weaknes of mans nature, which is not able to maintaine thinges long in any perfect ſtate, may decline in time to a tyranny or confuſion. But if the whéele of ſuch a ſtate be not turned with any ſud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>daine violent motion, but ſoftly &amp; in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeres, &amp; almoſt without any noyſe, then I ſay that in a certaine periode of tyme the lawfull and iuſt gouernement will be chaunged in déed into an vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full tyranny or confuſion. But yet while it is a turning, eſpecially in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning when the motions are leaſte, and hardeſt to be diſcerned, no man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſte
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:19102:180"/> can bee able to ſaye when this wheele was firſte moued, or whoſe hand firſt began to turne it. And this ſhal yet be harder if ſuch as haue fineſt ſenſes to diſcerne, euen of the moſt ſtill and inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible motions, vppon their diſcouering of them be charged and condemned as trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours to the ſtate. For by this meanes others which perceiue no ſenſible alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration are greatly hindred to diſcerne of their exact and exquiſite iudgement, and thinke rather that they were deceiued, &amp; worthely executed for ſome Treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtate. Whereas notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding after when the motions grow more forcible and violent, euerye meane wit will be able to diſcerne it, and in the ende no man ſo blind nor dull, but muſt needes perceiue it. And ſuch hath beene the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> In the tyme of the Apoſtle <hi>Paules</hi> preaching in it (for of <hi>Peters</hi> beeing there we haue no certaine ground in the ſcriptures), The ſtate of that Churche both for doctrine and diſcipline was perfect, and ſuch as the Lorde Ieſu him ſelfe had appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. After his tyme it continued in good
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:19102:180"/> ſtate while it was vnder perſecution e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to <hi>Constantines</hi> time, yet ſo that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen then the whéele began to turne. And tho the motions were ſo eaſie &amp; ſtil as all men perceiued them not, yet ſome of exquiſite iudgement, did diſcerne in it a ſlyding forwardes to this ſuperſticion and tyrannie. Amongeſt whome <hi>Ireneus</hi> noted <hi>Victor</hi> in the Queſtion of the daye to bee kept for Eaſter daye, to haue beene to peremptory, and to take to much vppon him to excommunicate the Eaſt churches for it, the matter being in it ſelfe indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and <hi>Victor</hi> hauing no authoritie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thoſe Churches. After when it had peace and reſt from perſecution, the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons grew faſter and ſwifter. For then it began to ſeeke for wealth, &amp; after wealth taking occaſion by the honour of the place being then the ſeat of the Empyre, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to affect ſome like preeminence in the church, and to draw as it were in the church the image of the Empyre. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of tho the rough draught was imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and a ſhadow of lyues not eaſie to be diſcerned, yet after the cole came the penſill, and then the colours, til at the laſt the whole image of the Empyre was to
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:19102:181"/> be ſeene in the ſtate of the Church. In which tyme fell out the falſification of the Canons of the counſell of <hi>Nice,</hi> reprooued by <hi>Austen</hi> and all the fathers of that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. Which liberty of theirs and the free eſtate of other churches as counterwholes ſo checked his courſe, that it could not goe faſt forward, til by the authoritie of <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi> hee had obtained the name of vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall Byſhop. Which being once ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, with in a while after it, grew to be ſuch as all were declared Heretiques, which ſhould ſpeake againſt it. And then the wheele was violently carried to this apoſtaſie from the trueth of the Goſpell, and as the motions were more ſenſible ſo more there were which perceyued it and ſpake againſt it. But notwithſtanding al the difficulties which might hinder this purpoſe, it appeareth for all the ſecreſie, ſubtletie, hipocriſie, authoritie, force and cunning, whereby they ſought to hide their wickedneſſe from the worlde, yet by the grace of God the beginners and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours of certaine of the degrees of this myſticall iniquitie are to bee diſcouered. Concerning the reſte we vndertake to prooue that what time or by whom ſoeuer
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:19102:181"/> they were brought in, that they were not taught by Chriſt nor his Apoſtles, nor in their tyme, which is our immoueable ground where on we build, that at what time, or by whome ſo euer it began it is not to be alowed nor receiued. M. <hi>Iewell</hi> of reuerend memory, did vndertake and per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fourme againſte them that twenty nine points, Wherin they differ from vs &amp; the primitiue church, Whenſoeuer after they were brought in, yet were not knowne, nor taught in the church for ſixe hundred yeres after Chriſt. Amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt which this is one which he nameth of the real preſence and conſequently. Their maſſe, which is another, for their Maſſe can not ſtande without a real preſence. And if neither in the time of Chriſt, nor ſixe hundred yéers after, they can prooue them to haue beene receiued, to what purpoſe is it to aſke when they began? let them rather ſhewe vs when they began, and prooue that ſo many points as haue beene offered them were receiued in ſo manye ſundry ages and times of the Church. Which if they can not doe, then let them acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their iuſte cauſe of ſatiſfaction and their wilfull oſtinacy againſt the truth.
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:19102:182"/> but to ſatiſfy him further in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> particulers he hath ſet down, I ſay firſt, touching the queſtion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> real preſence, it began to be moued after the daies of <hi>Charles</hi> the great in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> raigne of <hi>Charles</hi> his neuew. At what time <hi>Bertram</hi> an excellent clarke wrote a large volume of it, and prooued the words of the Supper, were to be vnderſtood in a miſtery and figure and not really. After whom <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> began to write for the vnderſtanding of the words of a real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. And after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both <hi>Bertrams</hi> iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was maintained by <hi>Berengarius,</hi> &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> French churches: and the opinion of <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſius</hi> by <hi>Lanfranc</hi> and others. Thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly was this controuerſie handled, till the <hi>Laterane</hi> counſell defyned of it, which yet the French churches, eſpecially of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iou</hi> and <hi>Yours,</hi> for a long time yéelded not vnto. Of this errour thus eſtabliſhed (as it commeth to paſſe, that one errour gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth occaſion of another) roſe anew que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion and controuerſie of tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was maruailouſly increaſed by the Canoniſts &amp; ſchoolemen, till at the laſt to make vp their impiety, <hi>Innocencius</hi> the third, made tranſubſtatiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenth article of the créed. As for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> authors
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:19102:182"/> of the ſundry peeces of their Maſſe, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre him to <hi>Platina</hi> and their owne ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who name the authours of the <hi>Sanctus, Lutroitus,</hi> collects, &amp; other the ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts &amp; peeces of it. By whom he may ſee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their maſſe was not brought to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme it hath now, till <hi>Gregories</hi> time, who gaue it in a manner that faſhion and forme which it hath at this preſent. He reckoneth here ſix other pointes, and firſt theſe three, Purgatorie, prayer for the deade, and interceſſion of Saintes. Whereof it is a maruaile how the third can agrée with the two former. For if they be in purgatory and néed our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, why ſhoulde we pray for them and ſeeke for their interceſſion. But for the time of the beginning of thoſe opinions I deny that any of them were vniuerſally taught, beleeued and practiſed in the Church of any auncient time. I graunt indéed, ſome learned men following their owne peculier opinion wrote of theſe que<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtions long agoe. Yet not ſo long as the aduerſarie would haue vs beleeue. But ſuch their particuler iudgement I deny to haue beene the general faith and practiſe of the Church at ſuch time. Of Praier for
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:19102:183"/> the dead, we read not in the moſt ancient fathers. For the prayers which are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioned in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, were ouer &amp; not for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead, &amp; were prayers of thankeſgiuing for their faithfull departure, &amp; not any requeſt for helping of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Soone after in déed it crept in, but <hi>Aerius</hi> and ſome other reproouing of it, tho the corruption of the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed againſt them. That the dead pray for vs, before <hi>Origens</hi> time, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taught &amp; yet he reporteth it, not as the publique fayth of the church, But as an opinion of an auncient Maſter of his of whome he hearde it, whoſe authoritie drew ſome of the other fathers after into that opinion. But of inuocation of Saintes there is no example in <hi>Origine, Chriſostome, Athanaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Tertulianus, Austen,</hi> nor <hi>Ierome.</hi> Nay four hundred &amp; ſeuenty yeares after that, a biſhop of <hi>Affrick</hi> was condemned for an heretique amongſt other pointes, for this that hee maintayned the bleſſed Virgin was to be prayed vnto, as <hi>Nic.</hi> reporteth Therefore it appeareth that theſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons came not from Chriſt, nor ſo many hundred yeres after, as hath beene decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which is more then we need to ſhew: it being ſufficient y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be prooued
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:19102:183"/> to be of Chriſt. For purgatory it appereth to haue come from the <hi>Egyptians</hi> &amp; the old Greeke poets, of whom <hi>Plato</hi> receiued it, and after <hi>Virgill,</hi> and diuers of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philoſophers and Poets. Whereof ſome after receiuing the faith of Chriſt, began to moue queſtion of that which they had beleeued in Paganiſme. As <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> did, which after <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine</hi> and <hi>Ierome</hi> ſought by allegoricall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the ſcriptures to confirme. But <hi>Austen</hi> examining y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeuerall points that <hi>Origine</hi> and his followers, had ſet downe of Purgatory, did plainly and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confute ſundry of the braunches of that opinion, and ſo ſhaketh the credite of the other, as he ſheweth they haue no certain foundation in the ſcripture. But this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie of <hi>Origine</hi> was ſtatly condemned by the fift generall counſel. Whereby it appeareth there were many y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> controled this hetheniſh fancy. For the reſt of their doctrine of ſaluation by works and grace inherent, it is the late diuinitie of their ſchoolemen, and vnknown to all antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which in ſuch ſenſe ſpake not of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite and of grace. For the number of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, the auncients vſing the worde
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:19102:184"/> not in ſo ſtraite a ſence manye times as we doe now in this queſtion diuerſly rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon them, but none that keepeth preciſely their account to reckon all their ſeuen for Sacraments, and neither more nor leſſe. Thus the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he may vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for his ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in theſe pointes, (and the like might bee ſhewed in their worſhipping of images, the Communion in one kinde, and of diuerſe of the reſt) that which hee required, at what time and by whom they were brought into the church Wherein alſo, hee maye ſee in ſundrye of them, who oppoſed themſelues to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of their Churche. Whereof if he deſire to ſee yet more, hee may reade that <hi>Iltiricas</hi> hath written expreſly, and large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of this argument. Who ſheweth that ſometimes, all the Churches of <hi>France,</hi> ſomtime the Churches of the Eaſt, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and in them diuerſe reuerende Fathers and famous Clearks, as <hi>Policarpus, Ireneus, Austen,</hi> and ſundry others, oppoſed themſelues to this miſterye of iniquitie, then working in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> To whoſe large diſcourſe, leauing him for further ſatiſfac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion in this matter, I proceede nowe to
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:19102:184"/> that which remaineth.</p>
            <p>Now to the reſt, which becauſe in effect it is nothing, but a complaint of extream dealing with them, which I haue anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before, and a requeſt to your Hh. for a mittigation of it (which your H wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes are to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider of) I haue not much to anſwere to it: yet briefly I haue thoght good to touche the reaſons. For which he would perſwade their cauſe to be worthy more fauor: which I call God to witnes, I doe not here, nor in any part of this aunſwere, of anye malice and hatred to them. For I acknowledge them for our Countrymen and brethren in the fleſhe, and would be glad my life might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for them, to bring them to the true knowledge of God in Chriſt, &amp; to the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of their ſoules. But my purpoſe herein, is faithfullye to diſcharge ſome part of my duty to Almighty God, and to her excellent Maieſtye, and your Hh. in maintening to my ſmal power this moſt holy &amp; honourable quarrell of Gods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſt his enimies, &amp; therby ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthning as much as lyeth in mee the right hand of a holy iuſtice, armed of God with a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing ſwoord againſt all euil doers, and
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:19102:185"/> eſpecially ſuch as euen to the with draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their duetifull obedience from their gracious &amp; naturall P. giue it to a forrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, &amp; obſtinately refuſe to worſhip God, and followe after Idols, and as drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſeeke to ſeduce the ſimple with all their endeuour to fall into the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction with them. He complayneth of great extremities with tragical ſpeeches, as the like rigour had neuer beene heard of in the worlde, that they ſuffer onely as he ſayth for their conſcience ſake. But I haue ſhewed a fore, and am agayn to put the gentle Reader in minde that for their Romiſhe faith, no one in all the time of her highnes happy raigne hath been tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched at all in his body. For Treaſon in deed, whereby they deny their obedience to her highnes, and acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſubiectes to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in many and moſt waighty caſes, and for ſeducing other to like diſobedience: Some of them haue beene executed according to the auncient lawes of this land, without any extraordinary extremitie, nay rather with fauor in caſe of high treaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And yet of this ſort the epiſtle of the perſecution in <hi>England,</hi> Whervnto he referreth him
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:19102:185" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſelfe. For proofe wherof he mentioneth on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly pretended Catholiques, that haue been ſo executed. In deed ſince ſome more vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on like reaſon, their cauſe being firſt iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially heard at the K. bench, and orderly proceeded in according to the courſe of law and iuſtice in ſuch caſe, beeing found guilty of hie treaſon, receiued like execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And this is the greateſt extremety which they can complaine of to this day. But he denieth that any one act word or thought was founde in them of treaſon, wherin he is conuicted of manifeſt truth, both by ſo many as were officers of her maieſties iuſtice vpon them, and by their owne confeſſions, as well of other matter as alſo of reconciling of diuers her high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſubiects to the pope, as it appeareth by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath bin publiſhed hereof by authori<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie. Whereby they acknowledge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes moſt vniuſt ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce againſt her H. as law<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full &amp; draw her Ma. ſubiects from her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: which the law of this land hath declared to bee high treaſon againſte her Highnes royall crowne and dignitie. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it heere inough to ſay that they do it in conſcience of their religion, for in many good conſciences they can not do it,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:19102:186"/> the B. of <hi>Rome</hi> by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde of God hauing no more to do in England: then any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, hath to do in <hi>Rome.</hi> And if without the word of God they will be caried in ſuch a courſe as cannot ſtand in any truth of religion or ſound pollicie, with the ſafetie of the ſtate, and ſecuritie of oure moſte lawfull Soueraigne oure whole common Wealth and Countrie, ſhould they cry out as if extreame cruelty were executed vpon them, if their excuſe of a pretenſed conſcience be not taken for a ſufficient aunſwer. Theſe cries &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints might worthely haue bene made by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore faithful people of <hi>Merindall</hi> &amp; of the valley of <hi>Anagrogne</hi> &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt when the Popes executioners waſted &amp; deſtroied <hi>7.</hi> townes of theirs. Alſo by our brethren in Q. <hi>Maries</hi> daies, which were burnt by doſens together in a fire. Likewiſe, by our brethren cruelly without any forme or proceſſe of iuſtice, murdred and ſlain in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> late butcheries and maſſacres of <hi>France.</hi> Then was it time to haue ſhewed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, but the bowels of Chriſt were not in them. Then was a time to haue ſhewd pitty, but their merciles harts were void of grace &amp; mercye. They were filled with
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:19102:186"/> gal, and bitternes, no fire was hot inough for them, no ſworde was ſharp ynough. The honourable and the common was all one to them, the learned and vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d age and the comly youth the man and the woman, the father and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne, the mother and the babe borne out of time, and murdered as ſoone as hee was born by their ſauage and barbarous crueltie. Theſe cry yet behinde the altar againſt them. <hi>O Lord, when wilt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge our bloud,</hi> and the Lord will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to hear them, and reuenge their cauſe vpon their bloudy enemies in the day of his wrath. Another reaſon is alleaged of the fauour they find in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Turke: which I haue aunſwered before, and anſwere here again, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they ſuffer that doctrine and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of their religion, which they holde in theſe parts, neither if they did, are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian P. to rule their Subiectes by the examples of Turks and heathen, but by the law of God. Who hath giuen to them this commandement to be obſerued in all their dominion, that neither anye man, nor his children, nor ſeruaunts, that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther home borne, or ſtrangers be ſuffered
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:19102:187"/> to prophane his Sabboth: and to pollute his holy ſeruice, leeſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt of the people of the lande learne of them, and ſo the wrath of God come ſuddenly vpon vs, for being acceſſaries to Idolatrie. As for the tolleration of the Iews, whoſoeuer they be, that ſuffer the exerciſe of their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with the blaſphemies they commonly vſe againſt Chriſt, make themſelues gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of al their wickednes, which the Lord keepe this lande from, as well as from the abhomination of the maſſe, But they maye remember that their Holye Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can tollerate the Blaſphemye of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and the filthineſſe of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Curteſains</hi> and Stewes, and take a yeerely rent of them for it, and for no reſpect will allowe the exerciſe of our moſt holy religion, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his own dominions or whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he may preuaile againſte vs, but by all meanes ſeeke to burne all the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of it to aſhes, and to ſhed their bloude as water to runne downe the Streetes. Further, if no proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Prince elſwhere haue executed any of theſe Catholiks for religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſeth: no more hath any for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe bin put to death with vs, as I haue ſhewed alredy. which being ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:19102:187"/> any profeſſyng the Goſpell put any of them to death for meere matter of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, let the Lorde iudge the wicked ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt by his own mouth. Now, for the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous crueltie and moſt ſauage immanitie vſed by them againſt vs: we haue ſhewed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine that pacience towardes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hitherto, as we haue not touched the life of any one of them. But if the Catholiques had practiſed Rebellions and Treaſons in the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of other Princes profeſſyng the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel as thei haue doen here with vs, no doubt but thei ſhould haue found the ſame reward of their wickedneſſe that thei haue doen here. For our doctrine it is vtterly vntrue, that any of the churches profeſſyng the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, or this of England vnder perſecution did euer thinke it vnlawfull to put to deathe a Rebell and a Traytour. Naie, it hath beene alwaies taught in all the reformed Churches, that bothe thei, and alſo obſtinate Heretickes (amongeſt whom thei haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies accounted and doe ſtill account all obſtinate and wilfull ſpreadors of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhe faithe, ſett doune by the Councell of Trent) are moſte worthie of death: that as it is in the Lawe, the falſe Prophett and the ſeducyng Idolater, maie bee taken
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:19102:188"/> from amongeſt vs, that all Iſraell maie heere and feare and not dare to committ the like. Wee acknowledge in deede faithe to be the gift of God, whiche commeth by the preachyng of the Goſpell by Miniſters ſent by the commaundement of God: but we do not therefore think it vnlawfull for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to execute the Lordes iuſt venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce vppon the obſtinate Heretickes and ſeducyng Idolaters. Repentaunce and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of life is alſo the gift of GOD, and commeth by the ſame meanes, and yet the Magiſtrate not onely in a good conſcience maie, but in duetie to God ought as he will anſwere it to him that ſhal iudge the quicke and the dead, drawe out the Lordes ſworde of execution of iuſtice and of vengeaunce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all ill doers, to wounde and to kill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng to the qualities of the offence. So likewiſe ought he in this caſe. And though conſcience and Religion bee not putt in by tormentes, yet maie one as Auſten alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, hauyng his obſtinacie chaſtened by the aucthoritie of the Magiſtrate, bee ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpp to conſider more ſeriouſly of the courſe he helde, and by ſuche occaſion gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng to a deeper exanimation of the cauſe, through the grace of GOD attaine to the
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:19102:188"/> true faithe. And if thei ſhould not, yet is not the puniſhment in vaine. For by it many which otherwiſe by a diſſolute lenity would be incouraged with impunitie, and followe the ſame wicked waies, are better aduiſed and kept from deſtruction: els were it in vaine ſaied whiche I haue alledged before, take awaie the euill one from amongſt you, that al Iſraell maie heare and feare and not dare to doe the like. But ſtil he ſtandeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their cauſe, vrging it to be vnworthie ſuche extremitie: and why ſo, becauſe our fathers haue beene as giltie herein as thei, hauyng profeſſed the ſame auncient Religion that thei doe now. But what is here in this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that might not ſerue all Heathen men before the preaching of the Apoſtles amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt them, &amp; moſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yet to this daye. If there were now any kingdome amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reformed according to the Goſpell, &amp; ſome ſhould ſtill maintaine their auncient Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, and pleade for them ſelues that they are no more giltie then their fathers and the fathers of their Magiſtrates had beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them? were this a ſufficient cauſe why thei ſhould be exempted from puniſhment? If our fathers were deceiued by theim, it ſtandeth vs their children &amp; poſteritie muche
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:19102:189"/> the more in hand to take heede of their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable waies and doctrine. It is more then we can aunſwere that our fathers haue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: It were wiſedome therefore that wee tooke heede we ad not ſinne to ſinne. Thoſe were the tymes whiche the Lorde regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not in reſpect of vouchſauing them this exceedyng fauour of the true knowledge of the Goſpell, but now he hath viſited vs from aboue, and called all men to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Whiche gracious goodneſſe of God toward this tyme, it were fitter for them to acknowledge, and receiue with thanckeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, then thus to obſtinate themſelues, to fill vp the meaſure of their Fathers ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie: that all the Idolatrie that hath been ſince the worſhippyng of the golden Calfe at mount Horeb, maie bee brought vppon theim. Haue thei forgotten that it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, To daie if ye will heare his voice, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den not your hartes as your fathers did in the wilderneſſe, who tempted and prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked God, till he ſware thei ſhould not enter into his reſte? Againe, he retourneth to the takyng awaie of that effecte, whiche this Iuſtice pretendeth to woorke, affirmyng vpon the woordes of Gamaliell, that thoſe men whiche of meere zeale, as he ſaieth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:19102:189"/> the Apoſtles maner, are come emongſt vs, to endaunger them ſelues to maintaine the faithe, can not bee made deſiſte if their counſell be of God. But I ſaie their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell cannot bee of God, becauſe the Faithe thei ſeeke to maintaine is againſt God, as giuyng to Idolls the honor of him, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is ſaied, thou ſhalt worſhip the Lorde thy God, and hym onely ſhalte thou ſerue: and againſte his anointed, as ſettyng vp many Sauiours, &amp; many Mediators, whereas it is ſaid, there is ſaluation in no other: and if any man ſinne, we haue an aduocate with God the Father, who is Ieſu Chriſte the righteous, he is the propitiation for our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Further I ſaie thei runne, and are not ſent of GOD, who ſendeth not any now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies after the Apoſtles maner to preache in all the worlde. Their miniſterie was neceſſarie for a tyme, that the voice of the Lorde might bee heard in all coaſtes, and the ſounde of it to the ende of the yearth. But now that the world hath heard it, their Miniſterie is ceaſed, and the Lorde calleth by their doctrine, and the miniſterie of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours and teachers of ſeuerall Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Therefore, well might an vnſkilfull Souldier bee father to theſe Ieſuites, that
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:19102:190"/> knewe not what he did. For, if he had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode any thyng of the woorde of God, he ſhould haue knowne that there is now no ſuche callyng, whiche thei maie profeſſe without more ſpecial warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei haue any. Therfore Gamaliell, that honourable Counſellour and Senatour beeyng their Iudge, thei muſt needes deſiſt, and al their purpoſes come to naught, becauſe thei are not of God. Your lordſhips honorable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, whiche hath releeued ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers giueth hym hope that thei maye alſo finde ſome comfort of the ſame: whiche I doubt not but if thei were as neere in faithe, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Sainctes, as theſe ſtraungers are, but thei ſhould vndoubtedly finde at your honours handes. But if thei that are of Dauids counſell and ſit at his table, lift vp their heeles againſte hym, a ſtraunger that feareth God, without all compariſon, is more deepely to taſte of your Lorſhipps honourable, ſuccour &amp; comfort, then ſuch a one though he were bred at home. Now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, what the effects of theſe your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips proceadynges maie bee, whiche for a farewell is diuerſly exaggerated: Firſte in this life, and then in the life to come. In this life thei muſt needes he ſaith to ſpeake
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:19102:190"/> plainly, <hi>bee ſubiecte to horror, obloquie, grudge, hatred, diuers breaches and moste daungerous woundes, as all extremities are wont to doe, and after that it can woorke no estimation, loue, or ſecuritie, to your poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</hi> Is this a duetifull ſpeeche of a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant vpon his knees, as he pretendeth to bee before your honourable aſſembly, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth this well with his often proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of reuerence and duetie? But the lorde that hath hetherto bleſſed your honors, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandyng the curſe of their chief cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers: I doubte not but if your honours ſhall yet further indeauor to ſerue the lorde in the ſincere aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cyng of his truthe, and the iuſte puniſhment of his enemies, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to the greate and honourable ſeruice he hath called you vnto, but that the ſame: Lorde whom you ſhall ſo ſerue, will tourne awaie all theſe threates of hatred and wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des, in your owne perſones, and your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie, from your honours and your noble children, vpon an Idolatrous and bloudie generation that knowe hym not, nor feare his name. Therefore, as our Sauior Chriſt ſpeaketh in a like caſe, when it was tolde hym, that Herod threatned to kil him, this Foxe is to remember that there are twelue
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:19102:191"/> howres in the daie, wherin who ſo walketh can take no hurte. Your honours &amp; all that profeſſe the truthe, walke vnder the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe and protection of the higheſt, who hath numbred the heares of your head, and without his will not one of theim ſhall fall vnto the ground. Thei whiche receiue the truthe, are to ſerue GOD in their ſondrie callynges, to the mainteinaunce of it in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and diſhonour, in wealthe and woe, in life and death. If there fall out any diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, it can not bee like the ſhame of the croſſe of Chriſte: If any woundes not like thoſe precious woundes, whiche he offered his holy body vnto for your ſakes. Suche diſhonour ſhalbe exceedingly recompenſed with a waightie Croune of glorie, ſuche woundes are the woundes of Chriſt, which the Apoſtle more boaſteth of (with a holie boaſte) then euer did ſoldiour of the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des he had in the field, for the defence of his Prince and Countrey, and ſuche woundes ſhalbe healed againe: yea, ſuche death ſhall be turned to a happie and euerlaſtyng life. Therefore, my humble praier to God for al your honourable Lordſhips is, that it maie pleaſe hym to fortifie, and ſtrengthen your noble hartes to continue, and proceade for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:19102:191"/> in this moſte holie courſe, to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncyng daiely of the truthe of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and the rootyng out of Antichriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, deſpiſyng all the threates, plattes and practiſes of the aduerſarie, with aſſurance that the watchman of Iſrall ſleepeth not. If his eyes bee open ouer all Iſraell night and daie to turne awaie all daungers from them, how carefull and vigilant an eye doth he keepe ouer Ieruſalem, and moſt of all watchfull and ielous is he ouer the houſe and freendes of Dauid. In the life to come he ſuppoſeth the Traytors worthely execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and other recuſantes impriſoned, ſhall be made equall to theſe who haue doen this iuſtice vppon theim, and that then all their paines ſhall bee aſſwaged, their teares wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped awaie, their racked partes reſetled, and thei receiued to euerlaſtyng peace and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. This I graunt ſhall in that daie be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to thoſe which ſuffer in Gods cauſe, and for bearyng witneſſe to our Sauiour and the truthe of his Goſpell. For ſo are we taught by our Sauiour himſelf, that he that leeſeth his life for him, ſhall finde it, by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng in the world to come life euerlaſtyng. Therefore, I nothyng doubt, but through the grace of God doe ſtedfaſtly beleeue, that
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:19102:192"/> in that daie, all our worthy fathers and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the noble hoſte of Martirs and true Souldiers of Chriſt Ieſu, whiche haue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered bothe in former tymes and in theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter daies els where, and here in Englande in the tyme of their moſt cruell and bloudie raigne, bothe ſuffered for the true profeſſion of the Goſpell of Chriſt, and ſhall be raiſed againe in that daie to raigne with hym in glorie. Then vndoubtedly though thei were burnt to aſhes or ſlaine with the murdring ſworde, or howſoeuer openly or ſecretly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, the Lorde will reſtore their bodies vnto them againe. Then the aſhes whiche the bones were burnt vnto, and are careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laied vp by the Lorde in his treaſurie, by the power whereby he is able to doe al thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſhall be reſtored to their former nature and be made bones again. Then according to the viſion of Ezechiell, euery bone ſhall come and ioyne it ſelf againe to the bone wherewith it is to bee ioyned, the ſinewes ſhall come vppon the bones, the fleſhe ſhall couer the ſinewes, and the breath of life ſhal be breathed into them. So they whom they thought thei had confounded for euer, ſhall ſtande vppon their feete againe as a trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant and victorious hoſte ouer all their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:19102:192"/> With the leaſt of which the ſaintes of God, in whom the Lorde will be maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous at his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng, not the proudeſt of the aduerſaries of the Goſpell ſhall be equall as he boaſteth: but in tremblyng and in feare ſhall ſtande before them, who ſhall aſſiſt the great Iudge in his hye Courte, accordyng as it is ſaied, you ſhall iudge the Aungelles. Therfore, let them not boaſt them ſelues of a vaine hope, for certainly there is no peace for the wicked ſaith the lorde. To trauel and torment them as he obiecteth, there is no man taketh any pleaſure in it. God forbidd we ſhould feede our eyes with the miſerable ſpectacle of their execution or our hartes in any their ſufferinges. We are ſo farre from it by the grace of God, that if we enioye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thyng that is good, wee wiſhe as good parte of it to them as to our ſelues. Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally beeyng vouchſafed that high fauour of God to beleeue in Chriſte accordyng to the truth of the Goſpell, and thereby to liue tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the ſame grace in the feare of his name, ſeruyng hym and our brethren with all our power in a happy aſſuraunce of the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our ſynnes, and a bleſſed hope and expectation of the glorie of God to be made manifeſt in vs, as in his ſonnes at the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

Wherein as through the ſame gracious promiſe of God in Chriſte, we are aſſured by the Sacred truthe of his Goſpell, to haue our parte of the hidden Manna, and of the Tree of life, whiche is in the middeſt of the Paradiſe of God, ſo we deſire with all our hartes, (if it bee ſo good in his eyes who is onely wiſe, onely merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and onely holie) that thei maie haue their part of that Manna, that Tree of life and newe wine of a heauenly grape, reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyng the harte of God and man, together with vs (as the Lord ſpeaketh in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,) eating and drinkyng at the heauenly table, and that we maie altogether raigne with Chriſt in his kyngdome for euer. As for the benefites of this life, I would to God their offences hindered theim not, to enioye theim aſwell as wee. If the Lorde haue giuen vs a good lande, as he hath in deede, &amp; plentiful of all good commodities of this life, we wiſh thei were partakers of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all together with vs. We take no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in their baniſhment abroad, our cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try

Therefore, as Iuda ſomtimes exhorted Iſrael, ſo we exhort the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> retourne ye children of Iſraell, <hi>Fight not againſt the Lorde God of your Fathers, for you can not prospere.</hi> When the Prodigall ſonne had waſted his fathers goods, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots in a ſtraunge countrey, &amp; beyng in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie and neede, longed after his fathers houſe again, he aduiſed to returne, to hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble himſelf to his father: and ſaie, father I haue ſinned againſt heauen &amp; againſt thee, &amp; am no more worthy to be called thy ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, make me but as one of thy hired ſeruants: and his father receiued hym with a greate feaſt at his own table, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> noiſe of Muſick and with all ioye.

Let them come &amp; fall doune before her excellent Maieſtie, and ſay: We haue ſinned againſt God, and againſt your highneſſe, and are not worthie to be accounted as ſubiectes, make vs but as ſeruauntes in the lande. Then no doubt but her gracious hart will melt ouer them, and her highneſſe will receiue them againe with ioy. And wheras thei lay al the blame vpon vs, whiche are their brethren, (if thei ſo returne) we wil be ſo farr from enuiyng it, that with the Aungelles of God we wil moſte willyngly and chearfully reioyce at their conuerſion, returning home again to God our heauenly father: when he whiche was loſte ſhall bee founde, and the ſonne which was ded ſhalbe reſtored to life again Loe the malice, that we who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei call their aduerſaries, and ſaie, to bee alwaies at the Magiſtrates elbowes, to ſtirre them vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, doe beare vnto them, God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
